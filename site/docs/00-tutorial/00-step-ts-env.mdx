# Step 0 - Setting up Your TypeScript Environment

:::info
*You can skip this step if you have a preferred environment setup*

Excalibur has a number of templates for various development environments, pick your favorite ðŸ’–
* [Vanilla JS](https://github.com/excaliburjs/template-vanilla-js)
* [Parcel](https://github.com/excaliburjs/template-ts-parcel-v2)
* [Webpack](https://github.com/excaliburjs/template-ts-webpack)
* Etc.

Setup your npm project with `npm init`, it will ask you for a series of questions and at the end you'll have a `package.json` file that describes how to run your project and it's dependencies

There are many ways to convert TypeScript into JavaScript so that it can be run by your browser. [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a popular choice because of it's ease of use and smart defaults out of the box. So called a "zero-config" bundler, however you can provide a configuration if you need to.


Download `vite` and `typescript` via npm as dev dependencies, these are dependencies that are only needed at development time.

```sh
npm install vite typescript --save-exact --save-dev
```

Download `excalibur` via npm as a normal dependency

```sh
npm install excalibur --save-exact
```

In your `package.json` file modify your `scripts:` section to add a few scripts.

```json
"scripts": {
    "start": "vite",
    "build": "tsc && vite build",
    "serve": "vite preview"
},
```

* `npm run start` will start your app in dev mode and start a dev server you can browse to
* `npm run build` will first run the TypeScript compiler `tsc` to type check, then run `vite`'s build to produce output HTML/JS/CSS for production.
* `npm run serve` will just serve a dev server, good for checking production builds.

Create an `index.html` and a `main.ts`, with `vite` you can directly include a reference to your TypeScript files, normally you cannot do this without a bundler like `vite`.
