# Step 2 - Adding a Bird Actor

Next let's making our first Actor for the Bird and `.add()` it to the default Excalibur Scene which can be accessed off the `Engine`. 

`Actor` **must** be added to the scene to be drawn.

First create a new file `bird.ts`

1. We can give it a position x,y in pixels
2. We can give it a color yellow

```typescript
// bird.ts

import * as ex from "excalibur";

export class Bird extends ex.Actor {
    constructor() {
        super({
            pos: ex.vec(200, 300),
            width: 16, // for now we'll use a box so we can see the rotation
            height: 16, // later we'll use a circle collider
            color: ex.Color.Yellow
        })
    }
}
```

Then we add it to our default scene.

```typescript
// main.ts 
import * as ex from 'excalibur';

import { Bird } from './bird';

const game = new ex.Engine({...});

const bird = new Bird();
game.add(bird); // adds the Bird Actor to the default scene

game.start();
```

Currently it doesn't do much for now but don't worry we'll get to it.
