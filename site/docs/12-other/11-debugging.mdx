### Issue: My game only shows a white screen

- Did you remember to call `game.start()`?

### Issue: My [[Actor]] or [[Entity]] is not drawing on the screen:

- Ensure your [[Actor]] or [[Entity]] is added to the correct [[Scene]].
- Add a name to your [[Actor]] or [[Entity]] and toggle debug to see if you can see it's name in debug
- Is your [[Actor]] or [[Entity]] offscreen? Check it's position in the debugger

### Issue: Poor/laggy game performance

- Consult our [performance guide](/docs/performance)

### Issue: My images show up as black rectangles on mobile or other platforms

- Ensure your images are less than 4k pixels in width or height, this is usually the limit for mobile devices in webgl.
