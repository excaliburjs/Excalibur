Timers are useful for running tasks synchronized with the Excalibur update and framerate, using the browser `setTimeout()` or `setInterval()`.

## Timer

Timers can be created to repeat forever or for a fixed number of repeats.

Timers do not start until they are explicitly started with `.start()` and added to a `Scene`

```typescript
const timer = new ex.Timer({
  fcn: () => console.log('Every 100 ms'),
  repeats: true,
  interval: 100,
})

game.currentScene.add(timer)

timer.start()
```

## Random Intervals

Timers can be created with random intervals.

For example, this timer will repeat every 500 milliseconds with an added random interval between 0-500 milliseconds.

```typescript
const random = new ex.Random(1337)
const timer = new ex.Timer({
  random,
  randomRange: [0, 500],
  interval: 500,
  repeats: true,
})
```

## One off callbacks

Instead of using the browser `setTimeout`, check out [[Clock.schedule]] you can read more in the [clock documentation](/docs/clock)
