# Pause System

The Pause System provides a flexible way to pause and resume entities in your game. This system allows you to selectively pause certain entities while allowing others to continue updating, giving you fine-grained control over your game's pause behavior.

## Overview

The Pause System consists of two main components:

- **`PauseComponent`** - A component that already is attached to [Actors](/docs/actors)
- **`PauseSystem`** - A system that manages pause state across all entities in a scene

## Quick Start

```ts twoslash include ex

// @include: ex
let scene = game.currentScene;
// ---cut---

// Create an actor that can be paused
const player = new ex.Actor({ x: 100, y: 100, canPause: true });
scene.add(player);

// Pause the scene
scene.pauseScene();

// Resume the scene
scene.resumeScene();
```

## PauseComponent

The `PauseComponent` tracks whether an entity is currently paused and whether it can be paused.

### Properties

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `paused` | `boolean` | `false` | Whether the entity is currently paused (read-only, managed by the system) |
| `canPause` | `boolean` | `false` | Whether this entity can be paused by the scene |

### Scene Events

[Scenes](/docs/scenes) now have `pauseScene()` and `resumeScene()` methods that emit out the pause state of the scene.

If you have UI elements, like a Pause Menu for example, that you want to respond to those events, you can listen to the scene's [events](/docs/events) emitter.
