## Keyboard

Keyboard input is accessible through [[Keyboard|engine.input.keyboard]]. You can inspect
whether a button was just [[Keyboard.wasPressed|pressed]] or [[Keyboard.wasReleased|released]] this frame, or
if the key is currently being [[Keyboard.isHeld|held]] down. Common keys are held in the [[Keys]]
enumeration but you can pass any character code to the methods.

Excalibur subscribes to the browser events and keeps track of
what keys are currently held, released, or pressed. A key can be held
for multiple frames, but a key cannot be pressed or released for more than one subsequent
update frame.

### Inspecting the keyboard

You can inspect [[Keyboard|engine.input.keyboard]] to see what the state of the keyboard
is during an update.

It is recommended that keyboard actions that directly effect actors be queried, instead of subscribed to:

```ts
class Player extends ex.Actor {
  public update(engine, delta) {
    if (
      engine.input.keyboard.isHeld(ex.Input.Keys.W) ||
      engine.input.keyboard.isHeld(ex.Input.Keys.Up)
    ) {
      player._moveForward()
    }

    if (engine.input.keyboard.wasPressed(ex.Input.Keys.Right)) {
      player._fire()
    }
  }
}
```

Checking whether keys are pressed or released during the update frame makes your game logic easier to follow and is less prone to tracking bugs since Excalibur tracks keyboard input on your behalf.

### Keyboard Events

If you need more complex logic or if you need to be notified when input was processed, you can subscribe to keyboard events through `engine.input.keyboard.on`. A [[KeyEvent]] object is
passed to your handler which offers information about the key that was part of the event.

- `press` - When a key was just pressed this frame
- `release` - When a key was just released this frame
- `hold` - Whenever a key is in the down position

```ts
engine.input.keyboard.on("press", (evt: KeyEvent) => {...});
engine.input.keyboard.on("release", (evt: KeyEvent) => {...});
engine.input.keyboard.on("hold", (evt: KeyEvent) => {...});
```
