Here are a few patterns and guidelines that you can use in your Excalibur projects.

## Project Structure

We have found this structure to work pretty well for games, see an [example game](https://github.com/excaliburjs/ludum-50)

```
game/
  images/
    image1.png
    image2.png
  sounds/
    sound1.mp3
    sound2.mp3
  src/
    main.ts
    level1.ts
    level2.ts
    config.ts
    resources.ts
    preferences.ts
```

## Entry Point

Define a `main.ts` file to serve as the "main" entrypoint into your game.

Keep the `main.ts` entrypoint as small as possible (this is where we create a new `ex.Engine()` and configure anything else at the engine level)

## Resource Loading

Keep all of our assets/resources in one file `resources.ts` and load them all at once in the `main.ts`

`embed:excalibur-snippets/src/resources/main.ts{snippet: "resources"}`

<IFrameEmbed src="https://excaliburjs.com/excalibur-snippets/resources/" />

## Configuration

Keep a `config.ts` for tweaking global constant values easily, we've wired up things like [dat.gui](https://github.com/dataarts/dat.gui) or [tweakpane](https://cocopon.github.io/tweakpane/) that make changing config during development easy

## Prefer `onInitialize` to the constructor

Where possible we use `onInitialize()` for initialization logic over the constructor, this saves CPU cycles because it's called before the first update an entity is needed and makes it easy to restart a game or reusing something by manually calling `onInitialize()`.

## Use `ex.Scene` as the [Composition Root](https://freecontent.manning.com/dependency-injection-in-net-2nd-edition-understanding-the-composition-root/)

Generally it is useful to extend ex.Scene (like in [level.ts](https://github.com/excaliburjs/ludum-50/blob/main/src/level.ts)) and use `onInitialize()` to assemble all the different bits of your game.

```typescript
class MyLevel extends ex.Scene {

  onInitialize() {
     const myActor1 = new ex.Actor({...});
     this.add(myActor1);

     const map = new ex.TileMap({...});
     this.add(map);
  }
}

```
