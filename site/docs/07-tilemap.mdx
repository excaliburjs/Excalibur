TileMaps can be useful tools to build levels for platformers or top down games.

Excalibur supports building tile based games, often referred to as "TileMaps." Excalibur has a [Tiled plugin](https://github.com/excaliburjs/excalibur-tiled/pull/162) to support the popular [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) editor map files.

## Tilemap

[[Tilemap|Tilemaps]] consist of a uniform grid of cells that can be solid or not. Each cell can have it's own graphics.

Tile maps are made up of [[Cell|Cells]] which can draw [[Graphics]]. Tile
maps support multiple layers of Graphics and work well for building tile-based games such as RPGs,
adventure games, strategy games, and others. Cells can be [[Cell.solid|solid]] so
that Actors can't pass through them.

## Tiled plugin

Excalibur has a Tiled map plugin https://github.com/excaliburjs/excalibur-tiled/ for loading `.tmx` maps.

We recommend using the [Tiled map editor](http://www.mapeditor.org/) to build your maps
and export them to JSON. You can then load them using a [[Resource|Generic Resource]]
and process them to create your levels. A [[TileMap]] can then be used as part of a
level or map class that adds enemies and builds game objects from the Tiled map.

## Currently unsupported

Hexagonal and Isometric TileMaps are not yet supported out of the box (but they are in our plans), but with some engenuity you can replicate them.

We recommend reading some of the [material on Red Blob Games](https://www.redblobgames.com/) for algorithms around Hexagonal and Isometric
