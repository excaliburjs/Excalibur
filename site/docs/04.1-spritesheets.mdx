SpriteSheet is really an ordered collection of sprites from the same base image.

```typescript
const spriteSheet = new ex.SpriteSheet({
  image: imageRun,
  sprites: [...]
})
```

## Uniform Grid Based Spritesheet

If you spritesheet is a neat grid there is a static builder for you to slice up that image source. Most sprite sheets are tightly packed like so.

Some source spritesheets may have margin between sprites and an offset, like these [playing cards from Kenny.nl](https://www.kenney.nl/assets/playing-cards-pack)

## Sparse Spritesheet

You can also build a spritesheet from a list of different sized source views using [[SpriteSheet.fromImageSourceWithSourceViews]] method

```typescript
const ss = ex.SpriteSheet.fromImageSourceWithSourceViews({
  image,
  sourceViews: [
    { x: 0, y: 0, width: 20, height: 30 },
    { x: 20, y: 0, width: 40, height: 50 },
  ],
})
```
