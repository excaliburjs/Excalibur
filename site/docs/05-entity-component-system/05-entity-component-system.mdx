Excalibur has a built in Entity Component System (ECS for short), which is a popular software technique in the video game industry
for managing behavior in a game in a composable and reusable way. Many ECS implementations also focus on memory cache optimization
techniques, that is not a goal of the current Excalibur implemenation.

## What is an Entity-Component-System

The [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) article does a pretty good job of explaining the design pattern, but here is the gist:

- [[Entity]] - Any "thing" in the game that has behavior, it has an id place to to put components.
- [[Component]] - Any state for a particular entity, generally these are state only, but can contain small amounts of logic
- [[System]] - Implementation of behavior given a set of components on an entity

Many of the features built in Excalibur are built using this, and users of Excalibur can make their own systems and/or replace
existing excalibur systems.

## Excalibur ECS Implementation

In addition to the familiar [[Entity]], [[Component]], and [[System]], Excalibur also implements an ECS [[World]] where all of these
pieces live and can interact together. Each [[Scene]] in Excalibur contains an ECS world, they are not shared between scenes.

Inside an ECS [[World]] there is an [[EntityManager]], [[QueryManager]], and [[SystemManager]] that handle all the details.

- [[EntityManager]] - Manages all the entities known by the world, it is an [[Observer]] of entity component changes over time.
- [[QueryManager]] - Manages all the entity queries, a [[Query]] allows a search of all known entities by a set of component types.
- [[SystemManager]] - Manages all the systems known by the world, it updates a [[System]] in priority order (low to high) and gives them a set of entities that match types.

Excalibur [[Actor]]'s are in fact [[Entity]]'s in this ECS implementation. Actors come "pre-installed" with a set of components and features.
