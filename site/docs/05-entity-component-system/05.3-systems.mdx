declare const game: ex.Engine;
```

Core behavior in Excalibur is implemented by Systems. Systems process all entities that have matching component types and perform some action.

Examples of systems are the [[GraphicsSystem]], [[MotionSystem]], [[CollisionSystem]], and [[DebugSystem]]

## System

Each Excalibur [[System]] loops through all entities in `System.priority` order.

## System Types

There are two system types [[SystemType.Update|update]] and [[SystemType.Draw|draw]].

[[SystemType.Update]] type systems all run before [[SystemType.Draw]] type systems.

## Lifecycle

- sort(a: Entity, b: Entity);
- update(entities: Entity[], delta: number);
- preupdate();
- postupdate();

## Built in Systems

Excalibur has a few built in systems that are used to enable the default behavior. These `Systems` are defined at Scene constructor time.

### [[MotionSystem]]

The motion system implements motion on entities, like Actors moving with velocity and acceleration.

This system makes use of the [[TransformComponent]] and [[MotionComponent]] to implement motion.

If a [[BodyComponent]] is present that will be used to apply sleep or global acceleration [[Physics.acc]] to all [[CollisionType.Active]] bodies.

### [[CollisionSystem]]

The collision system uses the [[TransformComponent]], [[MotionComponent]], and [[ColliderComponent]] to implement collision detection and resolution behavior.

### [[GraphicsSystem]]

The Excalibur GraphicsSystem takes any entity with a [[TransformComponent]] and a [[GraphicsComponent]] and draws it to the screen using the [[ExcaliburGraphicsContext]].

### [[DebugSystem]]

The debug system is slightly odd, it operates on all entities with a [[TransformComponent]] to display debug information to the screen when [[Engine.showDebug]] is enabled.

## Implementing your own Components & Systems

To build your own component, extend the Excalibur [[Component]] abstract class and pick a unique type name (duplicate type names will cause problems).

For custom component types it is recommended you prefix your types, like `type = 'myCustomPrefixTransform'`

In this example, we create a "search" type component, that searches for a target position. Notice how this component implementation is mostly data.

```ts twoslash
// @include: ex
// ---cut---
class SearchComponent extends ex.Component<'search'> {
    public readonly type = 'search'
    constructor(public target: ex.Vector) {
        super();
    }
}

class SearchSystem extends ex.System<ex.TransformComponent | SearchComponent> {
    // Types need to be listed as a const literal
    public readonly types = ['ex.transform', 'search'] as const;

    // Lower numbers mean higher priority
    // 99 is low priority
    public priority = 99;

    // Run this system in the "update" phase
    public systemType = ex.SystemType.Update

    private _searchSpeed = 100 // pixels/sec

    public update(entities: ex.Entity[], delta: number) {
        for (let entity of entities) {
            const target = entity.get(SearchComponent)!.target;
            // ex.TransformComponent is a built in type
            const transform = entity.get(ex.TransformComponent) as ex.TransformComponent;

            const direction = target.sub(transform.pos);
            const motion = direction.normalize().scale(this._searchSpeed);

            // Moves these entities towards the target at 10 pixels per second
            transform.pos = transform.pos.add(motion.scale(delta / 1000))
        }
    }
}

const scene = new ex.Scene();
scene.world.add(new SearchSystem());

// Actors come with batteries included built in features
const actor = new ex.Actor({
    pos: ex.vec(100, 100),
    width: 30,
    height: 30,
    color: ex.Color.Red
});
actor.addComponent(new SearchComponent(ex.vec(600, 400)));
```

Any entity that has the new component attached will be processed by the new system once added to the world!
