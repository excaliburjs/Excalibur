Core behavior in Excalibur is implemented by Systems. Systems process all entities that have matching component types and perform some action.

Examples of systems are the [[GraphicsSystem]], [[MotionSystem]], [[CollisionSystem]], and [[DebugSystem]]

## System

Each Excalibur [[System]] loops through all entities in `System.priority` order.

## System Types

There are two system types [[SystemType.Update|update]] and [[SystemType.Draw|draw]].

[[SystemType.Update]] type systems all run before [[SystemType.Draw]] type systems.

## Lifecycle

- sort(a: Entity, b: Entity);
- update(entities: Entity[], delta: number);
- preupdate();
- postupdate();

## Built in Systems

Excalibur has a few built in systems that are used to enable the default behavior. These `Systems` are defined at Scene constructor time.

### [[MotionSystem]]

The motion system implements motion on entities, like Actors moving with velocity and acceleration.

This system makes use of the [[TransformComponent]] and [[MotionComponent]] to implement motion.

If a [[BodyComponent]] is present that will be used to apply sleep or global acceleration [[Physics.acc]] to all [[CollisionType.Active]] bodies.

### [[CollisionSystem]]

The collision system uses the [[TransformComponent]], [[MotionComponent]], and [[ColliderComponent]] to implement collision detection and resolution behavior.

### [[GraphicsSystem]]

The Excalibur GraphicsSystem takes any entity with a [[TransformComponent]] and a [[GraphicsComponent]] and draws it to the screen using the [[ExcaliburGraphicsContext]].

### [[DebugSystem]]

The debug system is slightly odd, it operates on all entities with a [[TransformComponent]] to display debug information to the screen when [[Engine.showDebug]] is enabled.

## Implementing your own Components & Systems

To build your own component, extend the Excalibur [[Component]] abstract class and pick a unique type name (duplicate type names will cause problems).

For custom component types it is recommended you prefix your types, like `type = 'myCustomPrefixTransform'`

In this example, we create a "search" type component, that searches for a target position. Notice how this component implementation is mostly data.

Any entity that has the new component attached will be processed by the new system once added to the world!
