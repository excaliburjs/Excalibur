Cameras are attached to scenes and can be changed by
setting [[Scene.camera]]. By default, a [[Scene]] is initialized with a
[[Camera]] that doesn't move and is centered on the screen.

### Focus

Cameras have a position ([[Camera.x|x]], [[Camera.y|y]]) which means they center around a specific
[point](/docs/math#vectors).

If a camera is following an [Actor](/docs/actors), it will ensure the actor is always at the
center of the screen. You can use [[Camera.x]] and [[Camera.y]] instead if you wish to
offset the focal point.

### Camera strategies

Cameras can implement a number of strategies to track, follow, or exhibit custom behavior in relation to a target. A common reason to use a
strategy is to have the [[Camera]] follow an [[Actor]].

In order to user the different built-in strategies, you can access [[Camera.strategy]]

<Note variant="warning">

It is important to add the camera strategy in your Engine, Scene, or Actor's `onInitialize()`, the strategy will automatically update itself so do not put it in a update/draw lifecycle event.

</Note>

Lock the camera exactly to the center of the actor's bounding box

```typescript
game.currentScene.camera.strategy.lockToActor(actor)
```

Lock the camera to one axis of the actor, in this case follow the actors x position

```typescript
game.currentScene.camera.strategy.lockToActorAxis(actor, ex.Axis.X)
```

Elastically move the camera to an actor in a smooth motion see [[ElasticToActorStrategy]] for details

```typescript
game.currentScene.camera.strategy.elasticToActor(
  actor,
  cameraElasticity,
  cameraFriction
)
```

Keep the actor within a circle around the focus

```typescript
game.currentScene.camera.strategy.radiusAroundActor(actor, radius)
```

Keep the camera limited within camera constraints.  
Make sure that the camera bounds are at least as large as the viewport size.

```typescript
let boundingBox = new BoundingBox(
  leftBorder,
  topBorder,
  rightBorder,
  bottomBorder
)
game.currentScene.camera.strategy.limitCameraBounds(boundingBox)
```

#### Custom strategies

Custom strategies can be implemented by extending the [[CameraStrategy]] interface and added to cameras to build novel behavior with `ex.Camera.addStrategy<T>(new MyCameraStrategy<T>())`.

As shown below a camera strategy calculates a new camera position vector every frame given a target type, camera, engine, and elapsed delta in milliseconds.

```typescript
/**
 * Interface that describes a custom camera strategy for tracking targets
 */
export interface CameraStrategy<T> {
  /**
   * Target of the camera strategy that will be passed to the action
   */
  target: T

  /**
   * Camera strategies perform an action to calculate a new focus returned out of the strategy
   */
  action: (target: T, camera: Camera, engine: Engine, delta: number) => Vector
}
```

### Camera shake

To add some fun effects to your game, the [[Camera.shake]] method
will do a random shake. This is great for explosions, damage, and other
in-game effects.

### Camera lerp

"Lerp" is short for [Linear Interpolation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_interpolation)
and it enables the camera focus to move smoothly between two points using timing functions.
Use [[Camera.move]] to ease to a specific point using a provided [[EasingFunction]].

### Camera zooming

To adjust the zoom for your game, use [[Camera.zoom]] which will scale the
game accordingly. You can pass a duration to transition between zoom levels.
