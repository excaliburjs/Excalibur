Many times in your game you'll want to smoothly go from one scene to the next, or provide a custom effect when transitioning!

## Using Pre-Defined Scene Transitions

It is generally recommended that you define you scenes up front, when you do you have the opportunity to also specify the in/out transitions for a scene.

* `in` transitions play when the target scene has started, and will play the effect until the `duration` in milliseconds is complete
* `out` transitions play before the current scene is deactivated, the transition must complete before deactivation.

If no `in/out` transition is specified for a scene it will hard cut from one to the other.

```ts twoslash
// @include: ex
// ---cut---
const game = new ex.Engine({
  scenes: {
    scene1: {
      scene: MyScene,
      transitions: {
        in: new ex.FadeInOut({duration: 500, direction: 'in', color: ex.Color.Black}),
        out: new ex.FadeInOut({duration: 500, direction: 'out', color: ex.Color.Black})
      }
    },
    scene2: {
      scene: MyOtherScene,
      transitions: {
        in: new ex.FadeInOut({duration: 500, direction: 'in', color: ex.Color.Black}),
        out: new ex.FadeInOut({duration: 500, direction: 'out', color: ex.Color.Black})
      }
    }
  }
});


game.goToScene('scene1');

```

or using the add scene api

```ts twoslash
// @include: ex
// ---cut---
const game = new ex.Engine();

game.add('scene1', {
  scene: MyScene,
  transitions: {
    in: new ex.FadeInOut({duration: 500, direction: 'in', color: ex.Color.Black}),
    out: new ex.FadeInOut({duration: 500, direction: 'out', color: ex.Color.Black})
  }
});

```

## Transition Options
Transitions have a few tricks up their sleeves, you can control duration, direction, easing function, whether to hide any loaders, or block user input during the transition

```ts twoslash
// @include: ex
// ---cut---
const transition = new ex.Transition({
  /**
   * Transition duration in milliseconds
   */
  duration: 1000,

  /**
   * Optionally hides the loader during the transition
   *
   * If either the out or in transition have this set to true, then the loader will be hidden.
   *
   * Default false
   */
  hideLoader: false,

  /**
   * Optionally blocks user input during a transition
   *
   * Default false
   */
  blockInput: false,

  /**
   * Optionally specify a easing function, by default linear
   */
  easing: ex.EasingFunctions.Linear,
  /**
   * Optionally specify a transition direction, by default 'out'
   *
   * * For 'in' direction transitions start at 1 and complete is at 0
   * * For 'out' direction transitions start at 0 and complete is at 1
   */
  direction: 'out',
})
```

## Overriding Transitions

There are 2 ways to override pre-defined transitions

* `goToScene('myscene', { destinationIn: ..., sourceOut: ... })` takes the highest precedence and will override any transition
* Extending [[Scene.onTransition]] you can provide dynamic transitions depending on your scene's state

```typescript
class MyCustomScene extends ex.Scene {
  onTransition(direction: "in" | "out") {
    return new ex.FadeInOut({
      direction,
      color: ex.Color.Violet,
      duration: 2000
    });
  }
}
```

## FadeInOut

This transition does exactly as it sounds, you can specific a duration in milliseconds and it will fade in the specified `direction`. [[FadeInOut]] uses the color [[Color.Black]] by default.

* The `direction: 'in'` direction means the transition will start fully opaque (non-transparent), then transition to fully transparent.
* The `direction: 'out'` direction means the transition will start fully transparent, then transition to fully opaque (non-transparent).

## CrossFade

:::warning

[[CrossFade]] can only be used on the `in`` transition for a scene, this is because it needs to [[Engine.screenshot|screenshot]] the previous scene in order to cross fade it.

:::


You can specific a duration in milliseconds and it will fade in the specified `direction`. [[CrossFade]] takes a screen shot of the previous scene and blends that into the current scene.

* The `direction: 'in'` direction means the transition will start fully opaque (non-transparent), then transition to fully transparent.
* The `direction: 'out'` direction means the transition will start fully transparent, then transition to fully opaque (non-transparent).

## Starting Scene Transition

Sometimes you want a special start transition for the beginning of your game after loading. You may want to match the color, do something special, etc.

This can be done on the [[Engine.start]] by providing a start transition

```typescript
game.start('scene1',
{
  inTransition: startTransition
});

```

## Custom built Transitions

Transitions are really an [[Entity]] with a [[TransformComponent]] and [[GraphicsComponent]] that take up the entire screen and draw on top of everything by default `z = Infinity`.

To build your own custom transition, extend [[Transition]] and implement the stubbed methods

For example this is CrossFade's implementation

```typescript
export class CrossFade extends Transition {
  engine: Engine;
  image: HTMLImageElement;
  screenCover: Sprite;
  constructor(options: TransitionOptions & CrossFadeOptions) {
    super(options);
    this.name = `CrossFade#${this.id}`;
  }

  override async onPreviousSceneDeactivate(scene: Scene<unknown>) {
    this.image = await scene.engine.screenshot(true);
  }

  override onInitialize(engine: Engine): void {
    this.engine = engine;
    const bounds = engine.screen.getWorldBounds();
    this.transform.pos = vec(bounds.left, bounds.top);
    this.screenCover = ImageSource.fromHtmlImageElement(this.image).toSprite();
    this.graphics.add(this.screenCover);
    this.transform.scale = vec(1 / engine.screen.pixelRatio, 1 / engine.screen.pixelRatio);
    this.graphics.opacity = this.progress;
  }

  override onStart(_progress: number): void {
    this.graphics.opacity = this.progress;
  }

  override onReset() {
    this.graphics.opacity = this.progress;
  }

  override onEnd(progress: number): void {
    this.graphics.opacity = progress;
  }

  override onUpdate(progress: number): void {
    this.graphics.opacity = progress;
  }
}
```
