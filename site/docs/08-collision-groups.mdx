Collision groups are useful when you want to filter the collision that are possible between colliders
on a granular level above and beyond collision type. This idea is also known as collision layers, collision filters, or collision filtering.

```typescript
// Create a group for each distinct category of "collidable" in your game
const playerGroup = ex.CollisionGroupManager.create('player')
const npcGroup = ex.CollisionGroupManager.create('npcGroup')
const floorGroup = ex.CollisionGroupManager.create('floorGroup')
const enemyGroup = ex.CollisionGroupManager.create('enemyGroup')

// Define your rules
const playersCanCollideWith = ex.CollisionGroup.collidesWith([
  playersGroup, // collide with other players
  floorGroup, // collide with the floor
  enemyGroup, // collide with enemies
])

const enemiesCanCollideWith = ex.CollisionGroup.collidesWith([
  playerGroup, // collide with players
  floorGroup, // collide with the floor
])

const npcGroupCanCollideWith = ex.CollisionGroup.collidesWith([
  floorGroup, // only collides with the floor
])

const player = new ex.Actor({
  collisionGroup: playersCanCollideWith,
})

const npc = new ex.Actor({
  collisionGroup: npcGroupCanCollideWith,
})

const enemy = new ex.Actor({
  collisionGroup: enemiesCanCollideWith,
})

const floor = new ex.Actor({
  pos: ex.vec(100, 400),
  width: 100,
  height: 20,
  collisionGroup: floorGroup,
})
```
