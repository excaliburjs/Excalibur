## Audio with the [[Sound]] Resource

Excalibur supports any audio the browser supports like `.wav`, `.mp3`, and `.ogg`. Due to mixed browser support you may wish to specify a list of
source files and codecs, the order of the files specifies order of preference (we recommend mp3, wav).

Major Browser support table [documented on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Audio_and_video_delivery/Cross-browser_audio_basics#audio_codec_support)

Pass an instance of [[Sound]] to a [[Loader]] to preload it. Once a sound
is loaded, you can [[Sound.play|play]] it. You can pass an argument from 0.0 - 1.0
into [[Sound.play|play]] in order to play the sound at that volume.

```typescript
const game = new Engine({...});
const sound = new Sound('./path/to/my.mp3', './path/to/fallback.wav');

const loader = new Loader([sound]);
await game.start(loader);

sound.play(0.5);
```

See the [examples](https://excaliburjs.com/examples/?path=/docs/audio) or API documentation for [[Sound]] for additional features available such as looping, volume setting, and more.
