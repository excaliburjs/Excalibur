[[ActionsContext.follow|Follow]] can be useful for building things that need to follow behind another actor.

This method will cause the entity to follow another at a specified distance

<Note variant="warning">

This action will never complete! Any actions chained off of it will not fire. You will need to call `.clearActions()` to schedule new actions.

</Note>

```typescript
const friend = new ex.Actor({...});

const target = new ex.Actor({...});

// Follow the target at a distance of 100 pixels
friend.actions.follow(target, 100)

```
