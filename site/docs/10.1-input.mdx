Excalibur offers several modes of input for your games.

The [[Engine.input]] property can be inspected during [[Actor.update]]
or other areas of the game. This allows you to respond to any type
of user input without writing complex input event code yourself.

Learn more about [Keyboard](/docs/keyboard), [Mouse and Touch](/docs/pointers), and [Gamepads](/docs/gamepad) support.

### Inspecting engine input

Access [[Engine.input]] to see if any input is being tracked during the current update frame.

```ts
class Player extends ex.Actor {
  public update(engine, delta) {
    if (
      engine.input.keyboard.isHeld(ex.Input.Keys.W) ||
      engine.input.gamepads.at(0).getAxes(ex.Input.Axes.LeftStickY) > 0.5
    ) {
      player._moveForward()
    }
  }
}
```
