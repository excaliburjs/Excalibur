Often you want external images loaded into your game, this is accomplished with [[ImageSource]]. In some other engines/frameworks this can be known as a Texture.

[[ImageSource]] represents the source bitmap and contains the logic for loading that image from a file. You can think of this as the file representation in Excalibur for the image. Use [Sprites](/docs/sprites) to draw them to the screen.

## Loading Images with the [[ImageSource]] Resource

Excalibur supports `.png`, `.jpg`, `.gif`, and `.bmp` image sources with partial support for `.svg`

- `.png` and `.svg` will be completely lossless formats. For pixel art type games we recommend `.png`
- `.jpg` and `.gif` are lossy formats, useful to optimize for download size.
- `.bmp` are the biggest
- `base64` useful if you don't want to pay the loading time cost of your images at the expense of larger source download
  - `data:image/png;base64,BASE64DATA...`

```typescript
const game = new Engine({...});
const spriteSheetImage = new ImageSource('./my/spritesheet.png');

const loader = new Loader([spriteSheetImage]);
await game.start(loader);

const spriteSheet = SpriteSheet.fromImageSource({
  image: spriteFontImage,
  grid: {
    rows: 5,
    columns: 2,
    spriteWidth: 32, // pixels
    spriteHeight: 32 // pixels
  }
});

```

These images can be presented to the loader at the start of an Excalibur game

```typescript
const game = new ex.Engine({ width: 800, height: 600 })

const image = new ex.ImageSource('./img/myimg.png')

const loader = new ex.Loader()
loader.addResource(image)

game.start(loader).then(() => {
  // resources like ImageSource loaded before game started
})
```

Or they can be loaded out of band **Note: it is important to check that a ImageSource has been loaded before using it at runtime to avoid errors and visual bugs if your game is loading images this way.**

```typescript
const image = new ex.ImageSource('./img/myimg.png')

image.load().then(() => {
  // image loaded
  // good for use in sprites inside this function
})

if (image.isLoaded()) {
  // image.data is good for use in sprites
  const mySprite = image.toSprite()
}
```
