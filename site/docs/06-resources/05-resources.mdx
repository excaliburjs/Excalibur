## Why Resources

When building games you may have assets you want to load from an external file, like sound, art, etc.

Resources must be loaded before they can be used with a [[Loader]]

## Creating Loader for Resources

When calling [[Engine.start]], you can optionally pass an asset [[Loader]]. This loader will contain a reference to any [[Loadable|"loadables"]] you want to load.

```ts
const loader = new ex.Loader([
  /* add Loadables here */
])
```

[[Loadable|Loadables]] are different kinds of assets such as [image](/doc/imagesource), sounds, and generic resources.

<Note>

**Anytime** you call `game.start(loader)`, the game will pause and the engine will load assets. This means that you _do not have to load every asset at once_! Instead you may want to call `game.start(loader)` initially with core assets and then again when [initializing a Scene](/docs/scenes#initialization).

</Note>

## Generic [[Resource|Resources]]

Sometimes you may have some other type of file you'd like to load, perhaps some data stored in a text file, json, or perhaps some binary data.

Excalibur supports a generic [[Resource]] to load arbitrary data.

```
const game = new Engine({...});
const text = new Resource<string>('./path/to/my/data.txt', 'text');
const json = new Resource<MyJsonShapeType>('./path/to/my/json.json', 'json');

const loader = new Loader([text, json]);
await game.start(loader);

console.log(text.data);
console.log(json.data);
```

## Other Resources

- [[Gif]] resource supports loading Gif's as [[Animation|animation]], [[SpriteSheet|spritesheets]], or [[Sprite|sprites]]!
- The [Tiled](https://github.com/excaliburjs/excalibur-tiled) plugin adds support for Tiled map type resources

## Using a web server

The asset loader **only works with a web server** since it loads assets with [XHR](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest). That means you cannot use the loader when running an HTML file locally from the file-system (e.g. a `file://` protocol URL will not work). The browser throws errors that will prevent you from loading assets.

The fastest way to serve a folder of files is by using the [serve](https://npmjs.org/package/serve) NPM package.

```bash
# Serve the current directory
npx serve .

# Serve a folder
npx serve ./dist
```

If you are developing a game using Excalibur with Webpack, Parcel, or another bundler, these typically already come with dev servers for running your game. See [Excalibur project templates](/docs/installation#example-project-templates) for templates you can start from that use these tools.

### Relative vs. absolute paths

Given this directory structure:

```
/root
  src/
    game.js
  assets/
    textures/
      map.png
  index.html
```

And you serve from the `root` directory like this:

```
> cd root
> npx serve .

Now serving on http://localhost:3000/
```

The path to your assets doesn't matter as much because both absolute and relative paths will work:

- `/assets/textures/map.png => HTTP 200 OK`
- `assets/textures/map.png => HTTP 200 OK`

But if you are serving under a sub-directory, like `http://localhost:3000/root/index.html` then the format of your paths matter:

- `/assets/textures/map.png => HTTP 404 Not Found`
- `assets/textures/map.png => HTTP 200 OK`

The first path will fail to load as the absolute asset path would now be `/root/assets` and not `/assets`. Use a relative path to load assets _relative_ to the HTML file serving your game.

### Setting the base for a page

In your HTML file(s), to set the base for any absolute paths like the example above, you can use the [base](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/base) tag:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- Set the base for all absolute URLs -->
    <base href="/root" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- The browser will now properly resolve /root/game.js -->
    <script src="/game.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

This can be accessed programmatically using [document.baseUri](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/baseURI) to resolve absolute paths in JavaScript.

This is a good approach to use when hosting your game at a sub-directory, such as publishing to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
