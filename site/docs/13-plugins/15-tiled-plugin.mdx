[This extension](https://github.com/excaliburjs/excalibur-tiled) adds support for tile maps from all [Tiled map editor](http://mapeditor.org) files in Excalibur. Use the `TiledMapResource` to load and interact with Tiled based maps!

## Features

- Parse default Tiled tmx files
  - Supports all Tiled compressions zlib, gzip, and zstd
- Parse Tiled exported json files
- Supports external tilesets `.tsx` and `json`
- New TypeScript based object model for working with Tiled data
  - Query for layers by property
  - Query for objects by property
  - Easy helpers to locate Polygons, PolyLines, and Text
- Automatic Excalibur wiring for certain Tiled properties and objects:
  - Camera
  - Colliders
  - Solid TileMap Layers
  - Tiled Text
  - Inserted Tiled Tiles

## Quickstart

Install using [npm](http://npmjs.org):

```
> npm install @excaliburjs/plugin-tiled
```

## ES2015 (TS/JS)

The ES2015 `import` syntax is the recommended way to use Excalibur with Excalibur Tiled and is supported through a module loader like [webpack](https://github.com/excaliburjs/example-ts-webpack) or [Parcel](https://parceljs.org) with TypeScript or Babel:

```ts
import * as ex from 'excalibur'
import { TiledMapResource } from '@excaliburjs/plugin-tiled'

// Create tiled map resource, pointing to static asset path
const tiledMap = new TiledMapResource('/assets/map.tmx')

// Create a loader and reference the map
const loader = new ex.Loader([tiledMap])

// Start the game (starts the loader)
game.start(loader).then(function () {
  console.log('Game loaded')
  tiledMap.addTiledMapToScene(game.currentScene)
})
```

### Excalibur Wiring

You may opt-in to the Excalibur wiring by calling `addTiledMapToScene(someScene)`

```typescript
// After loading tiledMapResource
tiledMapResource.addTiledMapToScene(game.currentScene)
```

- **Only object layers with `"excalibur"=true` are parsed for objects**. These object layers can be retrieved with

  ```typescript
  const objects: TiledObjectGroup[] = tiledMapResource.getExcaliburObjects()
  ```

  ![object layer property menu in Tiled](https://github.com/excaliburjs/excalibur-tiled/raw/main/readme/excalibur-object.png)

- **Camera Position & Zoom** - You may set the starting camera position and zoom

  ![Tiled Position Object as Camera](https://github.com/excaliburjs/excalibur-tiled/raw/main/readme/camera.png)

  - In an object layer with a custom property "excalibur"=true
  - **Note** Only the first Camera in the first "excalibur"=true layer will be used
  - Create a Tiled "Point" with the Tiled Type "Camera"
  - Optionally, to set zoom other than the default of 1.0, create a custom property named "Zoom" with a numeric value

- **Solid layers** - You can mark a particular layers tiles as solid in Tiled

  ![Tiled Layer Marked Solid](https://github.com/excaliburjs/excalibur-tiled/blob/main/readme/solid.png)

  - In the Tiled layer properties, add a custom property named "Solid" with a boolean value `true`
  - The presence of a tile in this layer indicates that space is solid, the absence of a tile means it is not solid

- **Colliders** - You may position Excalibur colliders within Tiled
  ![Tiled Object as BoxCollider](https://github.com/excaliburjs/excalibur-tiled/raw/main/readme/collider.png)

  - In an object layer with a custom property "excalibur"=true
  - Create a "Circle" (ellipses are not supported) or "Rectangle"
    - Set the Tiled type to "BoxCollider" or "CircleCollider"
    - Optionally, to set an Excalibur collision type specify a custom property named "CollisionType" with the value
      - "Fixed" (default for colliders) - non-movable object
      - "Passive" - triggers events, does not participate in collision
      - "Active" - participates in collision and can be pushed around
      - "PreventCollision" - all collisions are ignored

- **Text** - You may insert excalibur labels within Tiled
  ![Tiled Text](https://github.com/excaliburjs/excalibur-tiled/raw/main/readme/text.png)

  - In an object layer with a custom property "excalibur"=true
  - Create a Tiled Text object
  - Optionally, you can set the "ZIndex" as a float custom tiled property
  - **⚠ A word of caution around fonts ⚠** - fonts are different on every operating system (some may not be available to your user unless you explicitly load them into the page with a font loader). See [here for some detail](https://erikonarheim.com/posts/dont-test-fonts/)

- **Inserted Tile Objects** - You may insert tiles on or off grid in Tiled with inserted tiles
  ![Tiled inserted tiles](https://github.com/excaliburjs/excalibur-tiled/raw/main/readme/insertedtile.png)
  - In an object layer with a custom property "excalibur"=true
  - Create a Tiled inserted Tile
  - Optionally, you can set the "ZIndex" as a float custom tiled property
  - Optionally, to set an Excalibur collision type specify a custom property named "CollisionType" with the value
    - "Fixed" non-movable object
    - "Passive" (default for inserted tiles) - triggers events, does not participate in collision
    - "Active" - participates in collision and can be pushed around
    - "PreventCollision" - all collisions are ignored

## Not Yet Supported Out of the Box

- Currently Isometric and Hexagonal maps are not directly supported by Excalibur TileMaps, however the data is still parsed by this plugin and can be used manually by accessing the `RawTiledMap` in `TiledMapResource.data.rawMap` after loading.

- Excalibur Text is limited at the moment and doesn't support Tiled word wrapping or Tiled text alignment other than the default "Left" horizontal, "Top" vertical alignments.

- Layer offsets are yet not supported.

- [Layer tinting](https://doc.mapeditor.org/en/latest/manual/layers/#tinting-layers) is not yet supported

- [Parallax factor](https://doc.mapeditor.org/en/latest/manual/layers/#parallax-factor) is not yet supported.

- Image Layers - Tiled image layers are not yet fully supported, but do show up in the `RawTiledMap` so can be used that way. Using inserted [Tile Objects](https://doc.mapeditor.org/fr/latest/manual/layers/#image-layers) is a way to achieve the same effect in a fully supported way.

- Group Layers - Tiled group layers are not yet supported at all, currently layers in a group do not load. Maps with group layers will load all other layers fine.

- Infinite maps - Tiled infinite maps are not yet supported, but do show up in the `RawTiledMap`.

- `RawTiledMap` fully types the Tiled 1.4.3 api, this can be used to write custom code for anything this plugin doesn't yet support.

```typescript
import * as ex from 'excalibur'
import { TiledMapResource } from '@excaliburjs/plugin-tiled'

// Create tiled map resource, pointing to static asset path
const tiledMap = new TiledMapResource('/assets/map.tmx')

// Create a loader and reference the map
const loader = new ex.Loader([tiledMap])

game.start(loader).then(function () {
  // Access raw data
  const rawMap = tiledMap.data.rawMap
})
```

## Webpack Configuration

You will need to modify your webpack configuration to load Tiled JSON files using `file-loader` and then ensure any TileMap images are copied to the same output directory as your bundle, see [this example-ts-webpack branch](https://github.com/excaliburjs/example-ts-webpack/tree/feature/excalibur-tiled-with-webpack) for an example.

## Standalone Script File (JS)

In your HTML file, add a reference **dist/excalibur-tiled.min.js** in your page:

```html
<script
  type="text/javascript"
  src="node_modules/excalibur/dist/excalibur.min.js"
></script>
<script
  type="text/javascript"
  src="node_modules/@excaliburjs/excalibur-tiled/dist/excalibur-tiled.min.js"
></script>
```

and then you can use it like this:

```js
// New game
const game = new ex.Engine({ width: 500, height: 400, canvasElementId: 'game' })

// Create a new TiledMapResource loadable
const tiledMap = new ex.Plugin.Tiled.TiledMapResource('test.tmx')

// Create a loader and reference the map
const loader = new ex.Loader([tiledMap])

// Start the game (starts the loader)
game.start(loader).then(function () {
  console.log('Game loaded')

  tiledMap.addTiledMapToScene(game.currentScene)
})
```

The dist uses a UMD build and will attach itself to the `ex.Plugin.Tiled` global if running in the browser standalone.
