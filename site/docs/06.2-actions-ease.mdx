The easing action is a lot like the [moveTo](/docs/actions-move#moveto) except you can specify an [[EasingFunction]]. With built in easing functions like [[EasingFunctionsEasingFunctions.EaseInOutCubic]] you can make things look really smooth.

https://easings.net/ is a great site to visualize easing functions

## EaseTo

This method will move an actor to the specified `x` and `y` position over the specified duration using a given [[EasingFunctions]]. This method is part of the actor 'Action' fluent API allowing action chaining.

```typescript
const actor = new ex.Actor({...})
// Move to (100, 100) in world coordinates over 1000ms using EaseInOutCubic
label.actions.easeTo(ex.vec(100, 100), 1000, ex.EasingFunctions.EaseInOutCubic)
```

## Custom Easing Functions

As long as you implement the easing function interface

The Standard easing functions for motion in Excalibur, defined on a domain of [0, duration] and a range from [+startValue,+endValue] given a time, the function will return a value from positive startValue to positive endValue.

```typescript
export interface EasingFunction {
  (
    currentTime: number,
    startValue: number,
    endValue: number,
    duration: number
  ): number
}
```

There is a helper to wrap your easing functions and make them reversible [[EasingFunctions.CreateReversibleEasingFunction]]
