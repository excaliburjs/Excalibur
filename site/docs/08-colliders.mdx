Colliders are abstractions over geometry in Excalibur, they implement the [[Collider]] interface and know how
to detect intersecions with other colliders, test ray casts, check point containment, etc. Related but not the same are [bodies](/docs/bodies) which are abstractions over the collision response

Colliders attached to an [[Entity]] will have a [[Entity.owner]] populated.

<Note>

**Keep in mind** colliders are relative to the owner [[TransformComponent]], they only represent geometry relative to an entity [[TransformComponent]]. Colliders can be shifted using the [[Collider.offset]].

Colliders don't have a position in the world without an Actor/Entity with a position

### CircleCollider

The [[CircleCollider]] defines a circular geometry and can be created and added to an actor

```typescript
// Actors have a built in circle collider if radius is set
const actorWithCircleCollider = new ex.Actor({
  pos: ex.vec(5, 5),
  radius: 10,
})

// Alternatively you can define and set a collider yourself

const circle = new ex.CircleCollider({
  radius: 10, // 10 pixel radius
})

// or

const circle = ex.Shape.Circle(10) // 10 pixel radius

const actor = new ex.Actor({
  pos: ex.vec(100, 100),
  collider: circle,
})

// Change the collider afterwards
actor.collider.set(circle)
```

### Box and PolygonCollider

The [[PolygonCollider]] allows the definition of arbitrary **convex** polygons. Convex meaning there are no dents in the shape, for example "Pac-Man" would be a non-convex shape.

A box collider is created using the PolygonCollider, there is a [[Shape.Box]] helper to build these.

```typescript
// Actors have a built in box collider if width/height are set
const actorWithBoxCollider = new ex.Actor({
  pos: ex.vec(100, 100),
  width: 100,
  height: 10,
})

// Alternatively you can define and set a collider yourself
const box = ex.Shape.Box(100, 10)

const actor = new ex.Actor({
  pos: ex.vec(100, 100),
  collider: box,
})
```

A polygon collider can be defined using a set of points specified in clockwise order (also known as "winding").

```typescript
const triangle = new ex.PolygonCollider({
  points: [ex.vec(-100, 0), ex.vec(0, -50), ex.vec(100, 0)],
})
```

### EdgeCollider

An [[EdgeCollider]] can be used to define a single line collider.

They are useful for creating walls, barriers, or platforms in your game.

Edge points are relative to the Entity position, so begin of `(0, 0)` means it starts right on the top of the Entity [[TransformComponent]]

```typescript
const edge = new ex.EdgeCollider({
  begin: ex.vec(0, 0),
  end: ex.vec(100, 0),
})

const actor = new ex.Actor({
  pos: ex.vec(100, 100),
  collider: edge,
})
```

### CompositeCollider

CompositeCollider can be used to attach multiple colliders to an entity at once. This can be useful when generating complex shapes, like for
example a capsule collider for a player Actor.

```typescript
// Capsule Collider
const capsule = new ex.CompositeCollider([
  ex.Shape.Circle(10, ex.vec(0, -20)),
  ex.Shape.Box(20, 40),
  ex.Shape.Circle(10, ex.vec(0, 20)),
])

const player = new ex.Actor({
  pos: ex.vec(100, 100),
  collider: capsule,
})
```
