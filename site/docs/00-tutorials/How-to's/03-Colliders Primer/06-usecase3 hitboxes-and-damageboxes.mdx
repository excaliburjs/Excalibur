### Problem

We have a player and an enemy, we want to whack the enemy and cause damage.  The player swings a weapon, and must collide with special hit boxes on the enemy.

Demonstrates:

- Using child actors for their colliders
- Using CollisionGroups to enable/disable collisions

Using the demo:

  - WASD to move the orange player
  - Enter key swings the weapon
  - Hitting the pink damage boxes causes the enemy damage (blink and flash)
  - Running the player into the enemy causes the player to blink

### Takeaways from this use case

#### The main actor doesn't have to have the collision ownership

You can use child actors for hit and damage boxes.

#### You can turn collisions on/off using ColliderGroups

As a game becomes more complex, it might be easier to control the collision arrangement via groups over each individual matched entity.
