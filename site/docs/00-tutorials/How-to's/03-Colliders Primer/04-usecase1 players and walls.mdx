## Problem Statement

We have a player, and we want it to not pass through walls or obstacles. (boundaries and obstacles)

We are showing how to encapsulate an area like a room, we are demonstrating a class 'pushed block' mechanism.  This includes changing the players speed when pushing.

Demonstrates:

  - Player with active collider
  - Walls with fixed colliders
  - Block with passive collider
  - Composite Colliders
  - Using collision events and event parameters
  - Using Debug mode to see the colliders

Using the demo:

 - WASD keys move the player around
 - You can't leave the room
 - You can push the block (Zelda style)

<PlaygroundEmbed code={usecase1} />

:::tip
- Using the 'separate' setting on composite collider allows for each element of the composite to register collider events
- Use an actor's velocity to move them to optimize collision resolution
- Click 'Toggle Debug' to see the example without the debug draws for colliders
:::

### Takeaways from this use case

#### Using different collider types.

Walls are fixed, Players are Active, and items that need to be 'managed' different can be passive and then you can determine how the behave when they collide

#### Composite Colliders

You can provide numerous colliders to an actor, and then combine them into 'one' collider to create unique shapes,... like room boundaries.

#### Using the events

When an event fires for an Actor, you can sort through all the events by the 'other' parameter and respond differently based on what is hitting the Actor.

### Debug mode

You can set debug mode programmatically, or use the dev tools to enable/disable.
