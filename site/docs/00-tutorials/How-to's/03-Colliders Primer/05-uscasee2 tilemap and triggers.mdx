## Problem Statement

We have a player, and we want it to not pass through the outer tiles of the tilemap.  We will use the solid property on the tiles to add a collider.  Also, we want the player to step on a trigger to show a prize.

Demonstrates:

- Tilemap colliders
- Triggers
- Collectibles
- Spawning

Using the demo:

  - WASD to move the orange player
  - The gray tiles are solid
  - The black circle is a button to press
  - Pressing the button drops a coin to pick up
  - Rinse and repeat

<PlaygroundEmbed code={usecase2} />

### Takeaways from this use case

#### Tilemaps can set the solid property on tile for any of the tiles

You can build whatever wall layout and each tile will have a collider on it.

#### Triggers can be used instead of Actors

Triggers are a special type of entity that can be less expensive than using an actor for just triggering a collision event.
