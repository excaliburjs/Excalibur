# Custom Graphics in ExcaliburJS

## Introduction

When you first start working with ExcaliburJS, most visuals come from sprites or built-in shape graphics like rectangles and circles. These cover a lot of common use cases—but eventually you’ll hit a point where your visuals need to respond to game state.

Health bars that shrink as damage is taken. Cooldown meters that fill over time. UI elements that are drawn procedurally instead of loaded from an image file.

That’s where custom Graphics come in.

In this tutorial, we’ll walk step-by-step through ExcaliburJS’s Graphic system, starting from the absolute basics and building toward a fully functional health bar graphic that visually reflects a changing value.

This guide focuses on understanding the mental model behind graphics—not just copying code—so you can confidently build your own dynamic visuals later.

### Who This Tutorial Is For

This tutorial is aimed at developers who:

- Are comfortable with TypeScript
- Have created actors and added them to an Engine
- Have used sprites or built-in graphics before
- Want to create UI or procedural visuals without external assets

You do not need prior knowledge of HTML Canvas or low-level rendering APIs. Everything we use is part of ExcaliburJS’s graphics abstraction.

### What You’ll Learn

By the end of this tutorial, you will:

- Understand what a Graphic is in ExcaliburJS
- Know how graphics relate to actors and screenElements
- Create your own custom Graphic class
- Draw shapes manually using the graphics pipeline
- Build a reusable health bar graphic that updates as health changes

Along the way, we’ll also cover common pitfalls and clarify where rendering responsibilities should live versus where gameplay logic belongs.
