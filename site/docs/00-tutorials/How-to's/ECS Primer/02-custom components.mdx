## Custom Components

Components are the building blocks of ECS. They store an entity’s state in a modular way. By creating custom components, you can:

- Encapsulate reusable data
- Expose helper methods to manipulate that data
- Keep logic separate from systems (or complement systems later)

A component should describe “what an entity has”, not “what it does.” Systems are where behavior happens — but components can have convenience methods that make life easier.

There are two ways you can build out a component:

1. The traditional way
2. [Systemless Components](systemless-components) (advanced)

Let's focus on traditional components first

### Example: Keyboard Control

```ts
import { Component, Engine } from 'excalibur';

type Directions = 'Left'|'Right'|'Up'|'Down';

export class PlayerMovementComponent extends Component {
  _enabled: boolean = true;
  speed = 150; 
  heldKeys: Directions = [];
  keyboard: Keyboard;

  conststructor(engine: Engine,speed?:number){
    super();
    if(speed) this.speed = speed;
    this.keyboard = engine.input.keyboard;
  }

  set enable(enable: boolean){
    this._enabled = enable;
  }

  get enable(){
    return this._enabled;
  }

```

To add this component to your Actor that you want controlled by keypress, simply:

```ts
import { Engine, Actor } from 'excalibur';
import { PlayerMovementComponent } from './PlayerMovementComponent';
import { MovementSystem } from './MovementSystem';

const engine = new Engine();
const player = new Actor({ x: 100, y: 100, width: 32, height: 32 });
player.addComponent(new PlayerMovementComponent(engine, 100));

engine.add(player);
engine.start();
```

and to access this componet in your code you simply use:

```ts
let keyboardControl = player.get(PlayerMovementCompontent);
// now keyboardControl has the speed, enable, and heldKeys properties on it!
// also it will have the engine reference to the keyboard input
```

We will look at the keyboard system in the next section.
