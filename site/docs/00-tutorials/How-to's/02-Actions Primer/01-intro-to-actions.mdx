## Introduction to Actions

In Excalibur, an [Action](/docs/actions) represents a unit of behavior that runs automatically over time — moving, rotating, waiting, or performing some game-specific behavior.  Think of it as the automation feature of Excalibur.  

Actions are not free-floating logic. They are executed and managed by the Actions Component in Excalibur’s ECS.

### The Actions Component

Every Actor in Excalibur comes with an ActionsComponent attached by default.

The ActionsComponent is responsible for:

- Holding the Action Queue
- Updating the currently running action
- Advancing to the next action when one completes
- Providing the Action Context (the entity) to actions at runtime

The actions component is stored under the `Actor.actions` convenience property.

### What an Action Really Does

An action will:

- Run over multiple frames
- Receive the elapsed time from the Engine
- Mutate properties of the actor while it runs
- Contain logic for when the action is completed

### Why Actions Exist

You could implement everything inside onPreUpdate or systems — but actions give you:

- Deterministic sequencing
- Readable behavior scripts
- Self-contained cleanup
- Easy composition
