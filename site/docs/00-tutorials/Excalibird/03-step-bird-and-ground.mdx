# Step 3 - The Bird and the Ground

Let's create some ground for the `Bird` to collide with, make a new `ground.ts` file.

We can use the `anchor` property to tell Excalibur how to align the default graphics and collider `(0, 0)` means top left, by default graphics and collider are centered around the position `pos`.

```typescript
// ground.ts
import * as ex from "excalibur";

export class Ground extends ex.Actor {
    moving = false;
    constructor(pos: ex.Vector) {
        super({
            pos,
            anchor: ex.vec(0, 0),
            height: 64,
            width: 400,
            color: ex.Color.fromHex('#bd9853'),
            z: 1 // position the ground above everything
        })
    }
    
    start() {
        this.moving = true;
    }

    stop() {
        this.moving = false;
    }
}
```


We can make our `Bird` move by giving it some acceleration in `onInitialize`, it is generally recommended to initialize state in `onInitialize`. It makes testing easier and defers initialization until excalibur primitives are available. `onInitialize` is called once before the first update of the `Actor`.

*BTW in Excalibur the positive y axis points down!*

```typescript
// bird.ts
import * as ex from 'excalibur';

export class Bird extends ex.Actor {
    ...
    override onInitialize(): void {
        this.start();
    }

    start() {
        this.acc = ex.vec(0, 1200); // pixels per second per second
	}

    stop() {
        // later we'll use this to stop our bird after collision
    }
}
```

Now we want to collide with the `Ground`.

```typescript
// bird.ts
import * as ex from 'excalibur';
import { Ground } from './ground';

export class Bird extends ex.Actor {
    ...

    override onCollisionStart(_self: ex.Collider, other: ex.Collider): void {
        if (other.owner instanceof Ground) {
            this.stop();
        }
    }

    stop() {
        this.vel = ex.vec(0, 0);
        this.acc = ex.vec(0, 0)
    }
}
```

Let's put our `Bird` and `Ground` together in the default `Scene`

```typescript
// main.ts
import * as ex from 'excalibur';
import { Bird } from './bird';
import { Ground } from './ground';

const game = new ex.Engine({...});

const bird = new Bird();
game.add(bird);

// drawHeight is the height of the visible drawing surface in game pixels
const ground = new Ground(ex.vec(0, game.screen.drawHeight - 64));
game.add(ground);

game.start();
```
