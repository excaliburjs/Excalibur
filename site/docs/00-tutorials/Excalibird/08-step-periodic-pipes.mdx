# Step 8 - Periodic Pipes

We want pipe to appear after a certain amount of time and for them to be in random positions. To accomplish this we'll use the `ex.Timer` which is a handy type for firing a callback periodically according to the excalibur `Clock` and `ex.Random` which provides a way of doing seeded random.

`ex.Timer`'s can be created and configured to `repeats:` infinitely at a certain `interval:`, and call a callback `fcn:`.

```typescript
import * as ex from 'excalibur';

// we'll use this timer below
this.timer = new ex.Timer({
    interval: intervalMs,
    repeats: true,
    action: () => this.spawnPipes()
});
// MUST BE added to a scene to work!!
this.level.add(this.timer);

```

Let's create a new type that's responsible for creating our `Pipe`s, we'll call it `PipeFactory`.

Create a new file `pipe-factory.ts`, note that this type is a plain old TypeScript/JavaScript class not extending any excalibur types.

The `spawnPipes()` method creates the top and bottom pipe using a random floating point number between 0 and the height of the screen taking into account the gap we want between pipes with `Config.PipeGap`.

We can `.start()`, `.stop()` the pipe factory and all the `Pipe`s created at the same time, also we added a `.reset()` which will come in handy later when we want to restart the game.


```typescript
// pipe-factory.ts
import * as ex from 'excalibur';
import { Bird } from './bird';
import { Ground } from './ground';
import { Pipe } from './pipe';
import { Config } from './config';

export class PipeFactory {

    private timer: ex.Timer;
    constructor(
        private level: Level,
        private random: ex.Random,
        intervalMs: number) {
            this.timer = new ex.Timer({
                interval: intervalMs,
                repeats: true,
                action: () => this.spawnPipes()
            });
            this.level.add(this.timer);
    }

    spawnPipes() {
        const randomPipePosition = this.random.floating(0, this.level.engine.screen.resolution.height - Config.PipeGap);

        const bottomPipe = new Pipe(
            ex.vec(this.level.engine.screen.drawWidth, randomPipePosition + Config.PipeGap),
            'bottom'
        );
        this.level.add(bottomPipe);

        const topPipe = new Pipe(
            ex.vec(this.level.engine.screen.drawWidth, randomPipePosition),
            'top'
        );
        this.level.add(topPipe);
    }

    start() {
        this.timer.start();
    }

    reset() {
        for (const actor of this.level.actors) {
            if (actor instanceof Pipe) {
                actor.kill();
            }
        }
    }

    stop() {
        this.timer.stop();
        for (const actor of this.level.actors) {
            if (actor instanceof Pipe) {
                actor.vel = ex.vec(0, 0);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

With this new `PipeFactory` we'll add it to our `Level` with a new `ex.Random`. If no seed is provided to `new ex.Random()` it'll use `Date.now()`

```typescript
// level.ts

import { PipeFactory } from './pipe-factory';

export class Level extends ex.Scene {
    random = new ex.Random();
    pipeFactory = new PipeFactory(this, this.random, Config.PipeInterval);
    bird = new Bird();
    ground!: Ground;

    onInitialize(engine: ex.Engine): void {
        ...

        this.pipeFactory.start();
    }
}
```
