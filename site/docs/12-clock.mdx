The Excalibur mainloop, the infinite update and draw cycle, is driven by the [[Clock]].

## Standard clock

The standard clock is the default, and runs continuously once started. The internal implementation uses the browser [`requestAnimationFrame()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame) to drive each game tick.

The FPS of the clock can be artificially limited in the [[Engine]] constructor, this can be useful to produce a consistent experience on many platforms or testing lower a framerate.

If no max is set, the FPS will be whatever the browser allows (usually display refresh rate)

For example, limiting to 30fps:

```typescript
const game = new ex.Engine({
    ...
    maxFps: 30
});
```

### Scheduling tasks (also see [[Timer]])

Instead of using the browser [`setTimeout()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/setTimeout) the clock can be used to schedule tasks that are tied to the excalibur clock, this means they will respect when a game is stopped and not fire.

```typescript
const game = new ex.Engine({...});
game.clock.schedule(() => {
    console.log('Hello in 300ms');
}, 300);
```

## Test clock

The test clock allows single stepping of each clock tick, which can be useful for debugging and unit testing.

### Stepping & Running the clock

```typescript
const game = new ex.Engine({...});
const testClock = game.debug.useTestClock();

// Single Step as if we are running 60fps
testClock.step(16.6);

// Multiple steps at once, for example 100 steps at 60fps
testClock.run(100, 16.6);

// to switch back to the standard clock
game.debug.useStandardClock();

```
