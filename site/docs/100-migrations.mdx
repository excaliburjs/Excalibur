## Migrating from v0.26.0 to v0.27.0

- `ex.Engine.snapToPixel` now defaults to `false`, it was unexpected to have pixel snapping on by default it has now been switched. You may need to explicitly switch it depending on your desired effect.
- The `ex.Physics.useRealisticPhysics()` physics solver has been updated to fix a bug in bounciness to be more physically accurate, this does change how physics behaves. Setting `ex.Body.bounciness = 0` will simulate the old behavior.
- `ex.TransformComponent.getGlobalMatrix()` has been removed, use this instead
  ```typescript
  const actor = new ex.Actor({...});
  const transform = actor.get(TransformComponent);
  const matrix = transform.get().matrix;
  ```
- `ex.TransformComponent.posChanged$` has been removed, it incurs a steep performance cost.
- `ex.EventDispatcher` meta events 'subscribe' and 'unsubscribe' were unused and undocumented and have been removed.
- `ex.TileMap` tiles are now drawn from the lower left by default to match with `ex.IsometricMap` and Tiled, but can be configured with `renderFromTopOfGraphic` to restore the previous behavior.

  ```typescript
  const tilemap = new ex.TileMap({
    ...
    renderFromTopOfGraphic: true
  })
  ```

- Scene `onActivate` and `onDeactivate` methods have been changed to receive a single context parameter, an object containing the `previousScene`, `nextScene`, and optional `data` passed in from `goToScene()`. Update any `onActivate` or `onDeactivate` handlers
  ```typescript
  onActivate(ctx: SceneActivationContext<TActivationData>) {
    ...
  }
  ```

## Migrating from v0.25.3 to v0.26.0

The old drawing API had been removed from excalibur, this should not affect you unless you were using the `ex.Flags.useLegacyDrawing()`. If so you must switch to the new [graphics api](/docs/graphics).

`ex.TileMap` has several breaking changes around naming, but brings it consistent with Tiled terminology and the new `ex.IsometricMap`. Additionally the new names are easier to follow.

- Constructor has been changed to the following
  ```typescript
  new ex.TileMap({
    pos: ex.vec(100, 100),
    tileWidth: 64,
    tileHeight: 48,
    rows: 20,
    columns: 20,
  })
  ```
- `ex.Cell` has been renamed to `ex.Tile`
  - `ex.Tile` now uses `addGraphic(...)`, `removeGraphic(...)`, `clearGraphics()` and `getGraphics()` instead of having an accessible `ex.Tile.graphics` array.
- `ex.TileMap.data` has been renamed to `ex.TileMap.tiles`
- `ex.TileMap.getCell(..)` has been renamed to `ex.TileMap.getTile(...)`
- `ex.TileMap.getCellByIndex(...)` has been renamed to `ex.TileMap.getTileByIndex(...)`
- `ex.TileMap.getCellByPoint(...)` has been renamed to `ex.TileMap.getTileByPoint(...)`

The following types have been removed:

- `ex.SortedList` old sorted list is removed, use the built in browser Array.sort
- `ex.Collection` old collection type is removed, use the built in browser Array
- `ex.Util` import site, exported code promoted `ex.*`
- `ex.DisplayMode.Position` is removed, use CSS to position the canvas
- `ex.Trait` interface, traits are not longer supported
- `ex.Promises` old promise implementation is removed in favor of browser promises

Notable method & property removals

- `ex.Actor`
  - `.getZIndex()` and `.setZIndex()` removed use `.z`
- `ex.Scene`
  - `.screenElements` removed in favor of `.entities`
  - `.addScreenElement(...)` removed use `.add(...)`
  - `.addTileMap(...)` removed use `.add(...)`
  - `.removeTileMap(...)` removed use `.remove(...)`
- `ex.Timer`
  - `.unpause()` removed use `.resume()`
- `ex.Camera`
  - `.rx` removed use `.angularVelocity`
- `ex.BodyComponent`
  - `.sx` removed use `.scaleFactor`
  - `.rx` removed use `.angularVelocity`
- `ex.ActionsComponent`
  - `.asPromise()` removed use `.toPromise()`
- `ex.ActionContext`
  - `.asPromise()` removed use `.toPromise()`
- `ex.Color`
  - Misspellings corrected

## Migrating from v0.25.1 to v0.25.2

- [[EventEmitter]] no longer tampers with `this` on the event callbacks which may be a breaking change for some people. Change callbacks's to be an arrow function to capture `this`

```typescript
class MyActor extends ex.Actor {
  constructor() {
    super()
    // Change from this
    this.on('precollision', this.onPreCollision)

    // To this
    this.on('precollision', (evt) => this.onPreCollision(evt))
  }
}
```

## Migrating from v0.24.5 to v0.25.0

### Graphics

- Replace `ex.Texture` with `ex.ImageSource`

- Replace `ex.Texture.asSprite()` with `ex.ImageSource.toSprit()`

```typescript
const image = new ex.ImageSource('./img/myimage.png')
// keep in mind this wont work until the image source is loaded
const sprite = image.toSprite()
```

- Update `ex.Sprite` constructor arguments

```typescript
const image = new ex.ImageSource('./path/to/image.png')
const sprite = new ex.Sprite({
  image: image,
  sourceView: {
    // Take a small slice of the source image starting at pixel (10, 10) with dimension 20 pixels x 20 pixels
    x: 10,
    y: 10,
    width: 20,
    height: 20,
  },
  destSize: {
    // Optionally specify a different projected size, otherwise use the source
    width: 100,
    height: 100,
  },
})
```

- Update `new ex.SpriteSheet()` constructor with `ex.SpriteSheet.fromImageSource()`

```typescript
const runImage = new ex.ImageSource(runImageSrc)

const runSheet = ex.SpriteSheet.fromImageSource({
  image: runImage,
  grid: {
    rows: 1,
    columns: 21,
    spriteWidth: 96,
    spriteHeight: 96,
  },
})
```

- Replace Legacy Drawing Usage

  - `ex.Actor.addDrawing()` with `ex.Actor.graphics.add()`
  - `ex.Actor.setDrawing()` with `ex.Actor.graphics.use()` or `ex.Actor.graphics.show()`

- Replace Legacy `ex.Actor.onPostDraw` and `ex.Actor.onPreDraw` with `actor.graphics` or `ex.Canvas`

```typescript
const canvas = new ex.Canvas({
  cache: true,
  draw: (ctx: CanvasRenderingContext2D) => {
    // custom drawing with CanvasRenderingContext2D
  },
})

actor.use(canvas)

actor.graphics.onPreDraw = (exctx: ExcaliburGraphicsContext) => {
  // custom drawing with ExcaliburGraphicsContext
}

actor.graphics.onPostDraw = (exctx: ExcaliburGraphicsContext) => {
  // custom drawing with ExcaliburGraphicsContext
}
```

### Actors

- Actor only supports the option bag constructor `new ex.Actor({...})`
- Label only supports the option bag constructor `new ex.Label({...})`
- Replace `ex.Actor.rx` with `ex.Actor.angularVelocity`

### Camera

- `ex.Camera.z` has been renamed to property `ex.Camera.zoom` which is the zoom factor
- `ex.Camera.zoom(...)` has been renamed to function `ex.Camera.zoomOverTime()`

### Engine

- `DisplayMode`'s have changed ([#1733](https://github.com/excaliburjs/Excalibur/issues/1733)) & ([#1928](https://github.com/excaliburjs/Excalibur/issues/1928)):

  - `DisplayMode.FitContainer` fits the screen to the available width/height in the canvas parent element, while maintaining aspect ratio and resolution
  - `DisplayMode.FillContainer` update the resolution and viewport dynamically to fill the available space in the canvas parent element, DOES NOT preserve `aspectRatio`
  - `DisplayMode.FitScreen` fits the screen to the available browser window space, while maintaining aspect ratio and resolution
  - `DisplayMode.FillScreen` now does what `DisplayMode.FullScreen` used to do, the resolution and viewport dynamically adjust to fill the available space in the window, DOES NOT preserve `aspectRatio` ([#1733](https://github.com/excaliburjs/Excalibur/issues/1733))
  - `DisplayMode.FullScreen` is now removed, use `Screen.goFullScreen()`.

### Physics

- Rename `ex.Edge` to `ex.EdgeCollider` and `ex.ConvexPolygon` to `ex.PolygonCollider`

### Timer

- Timers must be added to a scene and `Timer.start()` called for them to start
- `Timer.unpause()` has be deprecated in favor of `Timer.resume()` ([#1864](https://github.com/excaliburjs/Excalibur/issues/1864))

### Actions

- Rewrite `ex.Actor.actions.repeat()` and `ex.Actor.actions.repeatForever()` to use the `ctx` to define the set of repeating actions

```typescript
const actor = new ex.Actor()

actor.actions
  // Move up in a zig-zag by repeating 5 times
  .repeat((ctx) => {
    ctx.moveBy(10, 0, 10)
    ctx.moveBy(0, 10, 10)
  }, 5)
  .callMethod(() => {
    console.log('Done repeating!')
  })
```

### TileMap

- TileMap no longer needs registered SpriteSheets, `Sprite`'s can be added directly to `Cell`'s with `addGraphic`
  - The confusing `TileSprite` type is removed (Related to TileMap plugin updates https://github.com/excaliburjs/excalibur-tiled/issues/4, https://github.com/excaliburjs/excalibur-tiled/issues/23, https://github.com/excaliburjs/excalibur-tiled/issues/108)
