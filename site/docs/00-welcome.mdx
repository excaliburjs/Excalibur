## What is Excalibur?

Excalibur is a **free [open source](https://github.com/excaliburjs/Excalibur) 2D game engine** written in **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** for making 2D games for the web.

Our goal is to make it easier for you to create 2D HTML/JS games, whether you're new to game development or you're an experienced game developer. We take care of all of the boilerplate engine code, cross-platform targeting, and more! Use as much or as little as you need!
