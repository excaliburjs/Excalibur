## What is Excalibur?

Excalibur is a **free [open source](https://github.com/excaliburjs/Excalibur) 2D game engine** written in **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** for making 2D games for the web.

Our goal is to make it easier for you to create 2D HTML/JS games, whether you're new to game development or you're an experienced game developer. We take care of all of the boilerplate engine code, cross-platform targeting, and more! Use as much or as little as you need!

## Excalibur's Design Philosophy

1. Excalibur aims to be the best 2D game development experience for the web.
2. Excalibur is flexible with sensible defaults.
3. Excalibur is a "batteries included" game engine, you can just do the things you want.

## Excalibur is FOSS

Itâ€™s free and always will be. We welcome any feedback or contributions! If you make something with Excalibur, please [let us know](https://github.com/excaliburjs/Excalibur/discussions?discussions_q=category%3A%22Show+and+tell%22) so we can feature you in our online gallery.

## Excalibur is pre-1.0

We are still pre-1.0 but Excalibur has many powerful features built-in already that let you focus on building and designing your games. Please feel free to help [by contributing to the project](https://github.com/excaliburjs/Excalibur/)
