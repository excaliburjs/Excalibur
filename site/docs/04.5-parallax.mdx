The [[ParallaxComponent]] can be used for creating parallax effects on the graphics, entities with this component are drawn differently and a collider will not be where you expect. It is not recommended you use colliders with parallax entities.

```typescript
const actor = new ex.Actor()
// The actor will be drawn shifted based on the camera position scaled by the parallax factor
actor.addComponent(new ParallaxComponent(ex.vec(0.5, 0.5)))
```
