# Installation

:::tip First time here?

If this is your first time using Excalibur, we recommend you start with our [Excalibird](/docs/tutorial) tutorial where you can learn Excalibur in the browser.

:::

:::info Prerequisite for NPM

Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)

:::


NPM is the most common way to install Excalibur
```sh
npm install excalibur@latest`
```

But there are several ways you can start from scratch with Excalibur
- [From `npm`](#npm-package) or [`nuget`](#nuget-package)
- Using a template from the [Excalibur CLI](/docs/quick-start)
- [as ESM script](#esm-javascript), or [old school JavaScript](#old-school-javascript) from downloaded scripts on our [releases page](https://github.com/excaliburjs/Excalibur/releases)
- [by using a script CDN](#using-a-cdn) - e.g. for working with [`Deno`](https://deno.land/)


## Start From a Template

If you want to get up and running quickly with a familiar toolchain, we have several templates and samples available on GitHub. These examples allow you to simply clone and start building your game! They are also a great way to learn how to integrate Excalibur into your existing toolchain.

Check out the [Excalibur CLI](/docs/quick-start) to spin up a template or sample quick!

### Templates

- [Vite and TypeScript](https://github.com/excaliburjs/template-ts-vite)
- [Parcel 2 and TypeScript](https://github.com/excaliburjs/template-ts-parcel-v2)
- [Rollup and TypeScript](https://github.com/excaliburjs/template-ts-rollup)
- [Webpack and TypeScript](https://github.com/excaliburjs/template-ts-webpack)
- [Electron](https://github.com/excaliburjs/template-electron)
- [Capacitor](https://github.com/excaliburjs/template-capacitorjs)

### Samples

- [Sample Platfomer](https://github.com/excaliburjs/sample-platformer)
- [Sample Shootem-Up](https://github.com/excaliburjs/sample-shootemup)
- [Sample Brick Breaker](https://github.com/excaliburjs/sample-breakout)

### Older Templates

- [TypeScript, Angular2 & SystemJS](https://github.com/excaliburjs/example-ts-angular2)
- [TypeScript & Browserify](https://github.com/excaliburjs/example-ts-browserify)
- [Universal Windows Platform (UWP)](https://github.com/excaliburjs/example-uwp)
- [Apache Cordova](https://github.com/excaliburjs/example-cordova)
- [Xamarin Forms](https://github.com/excaliburjs/example-xamarin)

## Starting from Scratch

There are several ways you can start from scratch with Excalibur:

- as standalone packages [from `npm`](#npm-package) or [`nuget`](#nuget-package)
- [as raw script files](#script-reference-or-download) you can download
- [by using a CDN](#using-a-cdn) - e.g. for working with [`Deno`](https://deno.land/)

:::note

Excalibur is a client-side library and cannot be used in a
server-side Node.js, however it can be downloaded with npm.

:::

### npm Package

:::note

Best for JavaScript/TypeScript projects

:::

If youâ€™re using Node.js or intend to use Excalibur in a primarily JavaScript project, you can install it via [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm).

With [Node installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), run the following on the command-line:

```bash
npm install excalibur
```

This will add excalibur to your package.json as a project dependency and will create a folder structure like:

```
/node_modules
    /excalibur
        /build
            /dist
                excalibur.js
                excalibur.min.js
                excalibur.d.ts
                ...other files
```

See below for how to reference these files in your project after Excalibur is installed.

View the [excalibur](https://www.npmjs.com/package/excalibur) package on npm.

:::tip

If you used `npm` to install Excalibur, you can use the
`node_modules/excalibur/build/dist/excalibur.min.js` path above in the HTML. We
recommend [parcel](https://github.com/excaliburjs/example-ts-parcel) for quick projects or [webpack](https://github.com/excaliburjs/example-ts-webpack) for
more sophisticated projects. Read more about [builds and bundlers](/docs/bundlers)

:::

### ESM JavaScript

Excalibur publishes an ESM build that you can use with modern ES module syntax.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Excalibur Vanilla JS</title>
</head>
<body>
    <script type="importmap">
        {
            "imports": {
                "excalibur": "https://www.unpkg.com/excalibur@next/build/esm/excalibur.min.js"
            }
        }
    </script>
    <script type="module" src="src/game.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

### Old School JavaScript

:::note

Best for quick prototypes or small projects

:::

If you are using Excalibur in a script tag, [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/) provides a quick way to include published npm packages as scripts.

It is recommended you pin your version of excalibur to specific version like `excalibur@0.30.0`, however you can get the latest `https://unpkg.com/excalibur@latest`

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head></head>
  <body>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/excalibur@0.30.0"></script>
    <script src="./my-game.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

You can also download the compiled script from [Excalibur repository](https://github.com/excaliburjs/excalibur/releases).

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head></head>
  <body>
    <script src="excalibur.min.js"></script>
    <script src="./my-game.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Nuget Package

:::note

Best for .NET projects

:::

If you intend to use Excalibur in a primarily .NET-based project (like Xamarin, Windows 10, etc.), you can use [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/).

With the [.NET SDK installed](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/install/), run the following on the command-line:

    ```bash
    Install-Package Excalibur
    ```

Nuget will automatically place the Excalibur files in the `Content/Scripts` folder of your project:

```
/Content
    /Scripts
        excalibur.js
        excalibur.min.js
        excalibur.d.ts
        ...other files
```

See below for how to reference these files in your project after Excalibur is installed.

View the [Excalibur](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Excalibur/) package on Nuget.

### Using a CDN

If you want to use Excalibur in a [`Deno`](https://deno.land/) environment, use a content delivery network like [`esm.sh`](https://esm.sh/) or [`skypack.dev`](https://www.skypack.dev/). They transform our `NPM` package into an `ES Module`. That may sound complicated, but it's really just one line of code:

```typescript
// index.ts

import { Engine } from 'https://esm.sh/excalibur';

// and Tada!
const game = new Engine();
game.start();
```

:::tip

To see the full instructions on setting up Excalibur with `Deno`, check out [our `Deno` guide](https://excaliburjs.com/docs/bundlers#deno).

### Unstable Builds

If you want to live on the edge and get the latest unreleased and possibly unstable builds, you can download -alpha `npm` [packages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/excalibur).
