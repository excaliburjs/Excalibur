### Getting Excalibur

There are several ways you can get Excalibur:

- as standalone packages [from `npm`](#npm-package) or [`nuget`](#nuget-package)
- [as raw script files](#script-reference-or-download) you can download
- [by using one of our pre-made template repos](#github-templates)
- [by using a CDN](#using-a-cdn) - e.g. for working with [`Deno`](https://deno.land/)

<Note>

Excalibur is a client-side library and cannot be used in a
server-side Node.js, however it can be downloaded with npm.

</Note>

#### npm Package

<Note>

Best for JavaScript/TypeScript projects

</Note>

If you’re using Node.js or intend to use Excalibur in a primarily JavaScript project, you can install it via [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm).

With [Node installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), run the following on the command-line:

```bash
npm install excalibur
```

This will add excalibur to your package.json as a project dependency and will create a folder structure like:

```
/node_modules
    /excalibur
        /build
            /dist
                excalibur.js
                excalibur.min.js
                excalibur.d.ts
                ...other files
```

See below for how to reference these files in your project after Excalibur is installed.

View the [excalibur](https://www.npmjs.com/package/excalibur) package on npm.

<Note>

If you used `npm` to install Excalibur, you can use the
`node_modules/excalibur/build/dist/excalibur.min.js` path above in the HTML. We
recommend [parcel](https://github.com/excaliburjs/example-ts-parcel) for quick projects or [webpack](https://github.com/excaliburjs/example-ts-webpack) for
more sophisticated projects. Read more about [builds and bundlers](/docs/bundlers)

</Note>

#### Script Reference or Download

<Note>

Best for quick prototypes or small projects

</Note>

If you are using Excalibur in a script tag, [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/) provides a quick way to include published npm packages as scripts.

It is recommended you pin your version of excalibur to specific version like `excalibur@0.24.5`, however you can get the latest `https://unpkg.com/excalibur@latest`

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head></head>
  <body>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/excalibur@0.24.5"></script>
    <script src="./my-game.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

You can also download the compiled script from [Excalibur repository](https://github.com/excaliburjs/excalibur/releases).

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head></head>
  <body>
    <script src="excalibur.min.js"></script>
    <script src="./my-game.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

#### Nuget Package

<Note>

Best for .NET projects

</Note>

If you intend to use Excalibur in a primarily .NET-based project (like Xamarin, Windows 10, etc.), you can use [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/).

With the [.NET SDK installed](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/install/), run the following on the command-line:

    Install-Package Excalibur

Nuget will automatically place the Excalibur files in the `Content/Scripts` folder of your project:

```
/Content
    /Scripts
        excalibur.js
        excalibur.min.js
        excalibur.d.ts
        ...other files
```

See below for how to reference these files in your project after Excalibur is installed.

View the [Excalibur](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Excalibur/) package on Nuget.

#### Using a CDN

If you want to use Excalibur in a [`Deno`](https://deno.land/) environment, use a content delivery network like [`esm.sh`](https://esm.sh/) or [`skypack.dev`](https://www.skypack.dev/). They transform our `NPM` package into an `ES Module`. That may sound complicated, but it's really just one line of code:

```typescript
// index.ts

import { Engine } from 'https://esm.sh/excalibur'

// and Tada!
const game = new Engine()
game.start()
```

<Note>

To see the full instructions on setting up Excalibur with `Deno`, check out [our `Deno` guide](https://excaliburjs.com/docs/bundlers#deno).

</Note>

### Unstable Builds

If you want to live on the edge and get the latest unreleased and possibly unstable builds, you can download -alpha `npm` [packages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/excalibur).

### Example Project Templates & Samples

The excaliburjs organization on GitHub has several example projects:

#### GitHub Templates

- [Parcel 1 and TypeScript](https://github.com/excaliburjs/template-ts-parcel)
- [Parcel 2 and TypeScript](https://github.com/excaliburjs/template-ts-parcel-v2)
- [Webpack and TypeScript](https://github.com/excaliburjs/template-ts-webpack)
- [Rollup and TypeScript](https://github.com/excaliburjs/template-ts-rollup)
- [Vite and TypeScript](https://github.com/excaliburjs/template-ts-vite)

#### GitHub Samples

- [Sample Platfomer](https://github.com/excaliburjs/sample-platformer)
- [Sample Shootem-Up](https://github.com/excaliburjs/sample-shootemup)
- [Sample Brick Breaker](https://github.com/excaliburjs/sample-breakout)

#### Older GitHub Templates

- [TypeScript, Angular2 & SystemJS](https://github.com/excaliburjs/example-ts-angular2)
- [TypeScript & Browserify](https://github.com/excaliburjs/example-ts-browserify)
- [Universal Windows Platform (UWP)](https://github.com/excaliburjs/example-uwp)
- [Apache Cordova](https://github.com/excaliburjs/example-cordova)
- [Xamarin Forms](https://github.com/excaliburjs/example-xamarin)
- [Electron](https://github.com/excaliburjs/example-electron)

These examples allow you to simply clone and start building your game!

### TypeScript

We recommend using TypeScript for the best experience using Excalibur, but it will work just as well using plain JavaScript.

#### No Bundler or Loader via Triple-Slash Reference

If you are using a standalone script for Excalibur, you may want to use triple-slash references. It requires no extra module system or loaders!

```js
/// <reference path="node_modules/excalibur/build/dist/excalibur.d.ts" />

const game = new ex.Engine({ ... });
game.start();
```

Make sure the path is relative to the current TS file. You only need to include the reference on your “entrypoint” file. Then simply include `excalibur.min.js` as mentioned above in your HTML page.

You can also reference Excalibur through the `tsconfig.json`.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es5",
    "outFile": "game.js",
    "types": ["excalibur"]
  }
}
```
