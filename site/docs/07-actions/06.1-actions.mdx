## Actions

Actions can be chained together and can be set to repeat,
or can be interrupted to change.

Actor actions are available off of [[Actor.actions]].

### Chaining Actions

You can chain actions to create a script because the action
methods return the context, allowing you to build a queue of
actions that get executed as part of an [[ActionQueue]].

```ts
class Enemy extends ex.Actor {
  public patrol() {
    // clear existing queue
    this.actions.clearActions()
    // guard a choke point
    // move to 100, 100 and take 1.2s
    // wait for 3s
    // move back to 0, 100 and take 1.2s
    // wait for 3s
    // repeat
    this.actions.repeatForever((ctx) => {
      ctx.moveTo(100, 100, 1200).delay(3000).moveTo(0, 100, 1200).delay(3000)
    })
  }
}
```

### Example: Follow a Path

You can use [[ActionContext.moveTo|Actor.actions.moveTo]] to move to a specific point,
allowing you to chain together actions to form a path.

This example has a `Ship` follow a path that it guards by
spawning at the start point, moving to the end, then reversing
itself and repeating that forever.

```ts
public Ship extends ex.Actor {
  public onInitialize() {
    const path = [
      new ex.Vector(20, 20),
      new ex.Vector(50, 40),
      new ex.Vector(25, 30),
      new ex.Vector(75, 80)
    ];
    // spawn at start point
    this.repeatForever(ctx => {
      this.x = path[0].x;
      this.y = path[0].y;
      // create action queue
      // forward path (skip first spawn point)
      for (let i = 1; i < path.length; i++) {
        ctx.moveTo(path[i].x, path[i].y, 300);
      }

      // reverse path (skip last point)
      for (let i = path.length - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
        ctx.moveTo(path[i].x, path[i].y, 300);
      }
    });
  }
}
```

While this is a trivial example, the Action API allows complex
routines to be programmed for Actors. For example, using the
[Tiled Map Editor](http://mapeditor.org) you can create a map that
uses polylines to create paths, load in the JSON using a
[[Resource|Generic Resource]], create a [[TileMap]],
and spawn ships programmatically while utilizing the polylines
to automatically generate the actions needed to do pathing.

### Custom Actions

The API does allow you to implement new actions by implementing the [[Action]]
interface, but this will be improved in future versions as right now it
is meant for the Excalibur team and can be advanced to implement.

You can manually manipulate an Actor's [[ActionQueue]] using
[[Actor.actionQueue]]. For example, using [[ActionQueue.add]] for
custom actions.

### Future Plans

The Excalibur team is working on extending and rebuilding the Action API
in future versions to support multiple timelines/scripts, better eventing,
and a more robust API to allow for complex and customized actions.
