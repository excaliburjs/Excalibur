Moving actions are super useful for creating patrolling behavior, and are often paired with [repeat](/doc/actions-repeat#repeat) or [repeatForever](/doc/actions-repeat#repeat)

## MoveTo

This method will move an actor to the specified x and y world position at the speed specified (in pixels per second) and return back the actor. This method is part of the actor 'Action' fluent API allowing action chaining.

```typescript
const actor = new ex.Actor({...});

// move in a square at 200 pixels/second
// Actor will move exactly to those world coordinates
actor.actions.moveTo(ex.vec(100, 0), 200).moveTo(ex.vec(100, 100), 200).moveTo(ex.vec(0, 100), 200).moveTo(ex.vec(0, 0), 200);

```

## MoveBy

This method will move an actor by the specified x offset and y offset from the Actor's current position, at a certain speed. This method is part of the actor 'Action' fluent API allowing action chaining.

```typescript
const actor = new ex.Actor({
  pos: ex.vec(200, 200),
})

// move in a square at 200 pixels/second
// Actor will move relative to it's current (200, 200) position
actor.actions
  .moveBy(ex.vec(100, 0), 200)
  .moveBy(ex.vec(100, 100), 200)
  .moveBy(ex.vec(0, 100), 200)
  .moveBy(ex.vec(0, 0), 200)
```
