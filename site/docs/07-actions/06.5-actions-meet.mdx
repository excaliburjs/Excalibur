[[ActionsContext.meet|Meet]] can be useful for building tracking projectiles that always reach their target.

This method will cause the entity to move towards another until they are within 1 pixel of each other at a specified speed.

<Note variant="warning">

This action could possibly never complete! Any actions chained off of it will not fire until the target is met. You will need to call `.clearActions()` to schedule new actions.

</Note>

```typescript
const missile = new ex.Actor({...});

const target = new ex.Actor({...});

// Track towards the target at 100 pixels/second
missile.actions.meet(target, 100)

```
