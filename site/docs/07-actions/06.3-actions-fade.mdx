## Fade

This action method will cause Actor or Entity [[GraphicsComponent]] opacity to change from its current value to the provided value by a specified time (in milliseconds). This method is part of the actor 'Action' fluent API allowing action chaining.

```typescript
const actor = new ex.Actor({
  width: 100,
  height: 100,
  color: ex.Color.Red,
})

// fade to invisible over 2000 ms
actor.actions.fade(0, 2000)
```
