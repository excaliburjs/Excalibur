It is sometimes useful to repeat a sequence of action for your games. For example if you want an enemy to patrol back and forth, or for a platform to repeat a certain pattern.

## Repeat

This method will cause the actor to repeat all of the actions built in the `repeatBuilder` callback. If the number of repeats is not specified it will repeat forever. This method is part of the actor 'Action' fluent API allowing action chaining.

```typescript
// Move up in a zig-zag by repeated moveBy's
actor.actions.repeat((repeatCtx) => {
  repeatCtx.moveBy(10, 0, 10)
  repeatCtx.moveBy(0, 10, 10)
}, 5)
```

## Repeat Forever

This method will cause the actor to repeat all of the actions built in the `repeatBuilder` callback. If the number of repeats is not specified it will repeat forever. This method is part of the actor 'Action' fluent API allowing action chaining.

```typescript
// Move up in a zig-zag by repeated moveBy's
actor.actions.repeatForever((repeatCtx) => {
  repeatCtx.moveBy(10, 0, 10)
  repeatCtx.moveBy(0, 10, 10)
})
```
