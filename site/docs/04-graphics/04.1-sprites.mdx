A sprite is a view into a [ImageSource](#ImageSource) and a projection into a final destination size.

```typescript
const image = new ex.ImageSource('./img/myimage.png')
// keep in mind this wont work until the raw image is loaded
const sprite = new ex.Sprite({
  image: image,
  sourceView: {
    // Take a small slice of the source image starting at pixel (10, 10) with dimension 20 pixels x 20 pixels
    x: 10,
    y: 10,
    width: 20,
    height: 20,
  },
  destSize: {
    // Optionally specify a different projected size, otherwise use the source
    width: 100,
    height: 100,
  },
})
```

Many times a sprite is the exact same view and size as the source [raw image](#ImageSource) so there is a quick static helper to do this

```typescript
const image = new ex.ImageSource('./img/myimage.png')
// keep in mind this wont work until the image source is loaded
const sprite = image.toSprite()
```
