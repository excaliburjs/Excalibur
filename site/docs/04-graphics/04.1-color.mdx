## Colors

Excalibur provides some color static helpers you can use to work with Hex, RGBA and HSL colors. Colors expose different operations that allow you to change them such as lighten and darken.

### Creating colors

```js
// RGBA
new ex.Color(r, g, b, a)
ex.Color.fromRGB(r, g, b, a)

// HSLA
ex.Color.fromHSL(h, s, l, a)
// Hex, alpha optional
ex.Color.fromHex('#000000')
ex.Color.fromHex('#000000FF')

// String representation of a color with rgb as default
// Options include rgb,hsl,hex
ex.Color.toString('rgb')
```

## Working with colors

Since Javascript does not support structs, if you change a color "constant" like [[Color.Black]]
it will change it across the entire game. You can safely use the color operations
like [[Color.lighten]] and [[Color.darken]] because they `clone` the color to
return a new color. However, be aware that this can use up memory if used excessively.

Just be aware that if you directly alter properties (i.e. [[Color.r]], etc.) , this will change it
for all the code that uses that instance of Color.
