Excalibur [version 0.7.0](https://github.com/excaliburjs/Excalibur/releases/tag/v0.7.0) is now available! This is a very exciting milestone, as we have added a major feature!

## New physics system

We’ve implemented a rigid-body physics system, complete with edges, circles, and convex polygon primitives. This enables you to build fully-featured physics games in Excalibur! Fear not, the old physics system is still around for you to use.

## Generic lerping and easing

Excalibur now has generic functions for lerping and easing!
