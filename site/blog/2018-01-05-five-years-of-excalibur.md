## Five years in review

The first commit to Excalibur.js was published on January 5th, 2013. Since then, we’ve been working to build a game engine that’s easy to develop with and fun to use. Along the way, we put together a release pipeline, constructed a test suite, wrote a lot of documentation, and created a number of extensions and samples. Here’s a quick rundown of some of the numbers:

- 103068 npm downloads
- 1275 commits to core repository
- 447 closed issues
- 35 contributors
- 17 releases

## Future plans

There are some pretty big improvements coming up, and we’re looking forward to sharing those changes with you over the next year. We’re also working on a larger collection of samples and games to help new developers and showcase Excalibur’s capabilities. For a more detailed look, check out the [roadmap](https://github.com/excaliburjs/Excalibur/milestones).

## Thank you

We want to extend our sincere thanks to everyone who has written code, opened an issue, posted in our forum, or made a game and let us know about it. This is a very fulfilling project, and seeing others contribute to and use Excalibur means a lot to us. Thanks for your support!
