/**
 * CollisionGroups indicate like members that do not collide with each other. Use [[CollisionGroupManager]] to create [[CollisionGroup]]s
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * Players have collision group "player"
 *
 * ![Player Collision Group](/assets/images/docs/CollisionGroupsPlayer.png)
 *
 * Enemies have collision group "enemy"
 *
 * ![Enemy Collision Group](/assets/images/docs/CollisionGroupsEnemy.png)
 *
 * Blocks have collision group "ground"
 *
 * ![Ground collision group](/assets/images/docs/CollisionGroupsGround.png)
 *
 * Players don't collide with each other, but enemies and blocks. Likewise, enemies don't collide with each other but collide
 * with players and blocks.
 *
 * This is done with bitmasking, see the following pseudo-code
 *
 * PlayerGroup = `0b001`
 * PlayerGroupMask = `0b110`
 *
 * EnemyGroup = `0b010`
 * EnemyGroupMask = `0b101`
 *
 * BlockGroup = `0b100`
 * BlockGroupMask = `0b011`
 *
 * Should Players collide? No because the bitwise mask evaluates to 0
 * `(player1.group & player2.mask) === 0`
 * `(0b001 & 0b110) === 0`
 *
 * Should Players and Enemies collide? Yes because the bitwise mask is non-zero
 * `(player1.group & enemy1.mask) === 1`
 * `(0b001 & 0b101) === 1`
 *
 * Should Players and Blocks collide? Yes because the bitwise mask is non-zero
 * `(player1.group & blocks1.mask) === 1`
 * `(0b001 & 0b011) === 1`
