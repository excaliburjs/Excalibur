Excalibur is a free game engine written in TypeScript for making 2D games in HTML5 canvas. Our goal is to make it easier for you to create 2D HTML/JS games, whether you're new to game development or you're an experienced game developer. We take care of all of the boilerplate engine code, cross-platform targeting (using [browserstack](http://browserstack.com/) ðŸ˜Ž), and more! Use as much or as little as you need!

Excalibur is an open source project licensed under the 2-clause BSD license (this means you can use it in commercial projects!). It's free and always will be. We welcome any feedback or contributions! If you make something with Excalibur, please [let us know](https://github.com/excaliburjs/Excalibur/discussions?discussions_q=category%3A%22Show+and+tell%22)!

:exclamation: **_Note:_** Excalibur is still in version 0.x, which means this project and its associated plugins may be a little rough around the edges. We try to minimize API changes, but breaking changes **will occur** in new released versions. Excalibur is a labor of love and the product of many hours of spare time. Thanks for checking it out!

# Writing Documentation

We love when people help improve our documentation. You can contribute to the docs in [this repository](https://github.com/excaliburjs/excaliburjs.github.io).

## Environment Setup

The Excalibur.js team primarily uses [Visual Studio Code](http://code.visualstudio.com) as a platform agnostic editor to
allow the widest contributions possible. However, you can always use your own preferred editor.

## Testing

[![Browserstack](/assets/browserstack-logo-150x34.png?raw=true)](http://browserstack.com/)

Excalibur is committed to supporting the latest 2 versions of popular desktop and mobile browsers. We leverage [browserstack](http://browserstack.com/) automated testing to ensure that Excalibur is automatically tested as thoroughly as possible on all our supported platforms.

### Prerequisites

- **Required:** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 14.x & npm 6.x
- _Recommended:_ [Prettier plugin for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
- _Recommended:_ [ESLint plugin for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)

After cloning the repository, run:

```sh
npm install
```

You can then run the npm tasks for various purposes:

```bash
# Run compilation, linting, and all unit & visual tests
# Recommend to do this before finalizing pull requests
npm run all

# Run engine core compilation only
# Useful for quick checks to ensure everything compiles
npm run build

# Run engine tests only (does not run compile task)
# Useful to run tests ad-hoc
npm test
npm run test

# Start Storybook-based sandbox
# Used for creating interactive visual tests and examples for docs
npm run sandbox

# Compile API docs
npm run apidocs

# Build a nuget package and specify a version
npm run nuget -- 1.1.1
```
