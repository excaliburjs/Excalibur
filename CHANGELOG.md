# Change Log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Breaking Changes

- `Timer`'s no longer automatically start when added to a `Scene`, this `Timer.start()` must be called. ([#1865](ttps://github.com/excaliburjs/Excalibur/issues/1865))
- `Timer.complete` is now read-only to prevent odd bugs, use `reset()`, `stop()`, and `start()` to manipulate timers.
- `Actor.actions.repeat()` and `Actor.actions.repeatForever()` now require a handler that specifies the actions to repeat. This is more clear and helps prevent bugs like #1891

  ```typescript
  const actor = new ex.Actor();

  actor.actions
    // Move up in a zig-zag by repeating 5 times
    .repeat((ctx) => {
      ctx.moveBy(10, 0, 10);
      ctx.moveBy(0, 10, 10);
    }, 5)
    .callMethod(() => {
      console.log('Done repeating!');
    });
  ```

- Removes `Entity.components` as a way to access, add, and remove components
- Camera.z has been renamed to property `zoom` which is the zoom factor
- Camera.zoom(...) has been renamed to function `zoomOverTime()`
- TileMap no longer needs registered SpriteSheets, `Sprite`'s can be added directly to `Cell`'s with `addSprite`
  - The confusing `TileSprite` type is removed (Related to TileMap plugin updates https://github.com/excaliburjs/excalibur-tiled/issues/4, https://github.com/excaliburjs/excalibur-tiled/issues/23, https://github.com/excaliburjs/excalibur-tiled/issues/108)
- Directly changing debug drawing by `engine.isDebug = value` has been replaced by `engine.showDebug(value)` and `engine.toggleDebug()` ([#1655](https://github.com/excaliburjs/Excalibur/issues/1655))
- `UIActor` Class instances need to be replaced to `ScreenElement` (This Class it's marked as Obsolete) ([#1656](https://github.com/excaliburjs/Excalibur/issues/1656))
- Switch to browser based promise, the Excalibur implementation `ex.Promise` is marked deprecated ([#994](https://github.com/excaliburjs/Excalibur/issues/994))

- `DisplayMode`'s have changed ([#1733](https://github.com/excaliburjs/Excalibur/issues/1733)) & ([#1928](https://github.com/excaliburjs/Excalibur/issues/1928)):

  - `DisplayMode.FitContainer` fits the screen to the available width/height in the canvas parent element, while maintaining aspect ratio and resolution
  - `DisplayMode.FillContainer` update the resolution and viewport dyanmically to fill the available space in the canvas parent element, DOES NOT preserve `aspectRatio`
  - `DisplayMode.FitScreen` fits the screen to the available browser window space, while maintaining aspect ratio and resolution
  - `DisplayMode.FillScreen` now does what `DisplayMode.FullScreen` used to do, the resolution and viewport dynamically adjust to fill the available space in the window, DOES NOT preserve `aspectRatio` ([#1733](https://github.com/excaliburjs/Excalibur/issues/1733))
  - `DisplayMode.FullScreen` is now removed, use `Screen.goFullScreen()`.

- `SpriteSheet` now is immutable after creation to reduce chance of bugs if you modified a public field. The following properties are read-only: `columns`, `rows`, `spWidth`, `spHeight`, `image`, `sprites` and `spacing`.
- `Engine.pointerScope` now defaults to a more expected `ex.Input.PointerScope.Canvas` instead of `ex.Input.PointerScope.Document` which can cause frustrating bugs if building an HTML app with Excalibur

- Actions `moveTo()`, `moveBy()`, `easeTo()`, `scaleTo()`, and `scaleBy()` now have vector overloads
- `Animation.fromSpriteSheet` will now log a warning if an index into the `SpriteSheet` is invalid ([#1856](https://github.com/excaliburjs/Excalibur/issues/1856))
- `new ImageSource()` will now log a warning if an image type isn't fully supported. ([#1855](https://github.com/excaliburjs/Excalibur/issues/1855))
- `Timer.start()` to explicitly start timers, and `Timer.stop()` to stop timers and "rewind" them.

  - Tag `offscreen` is now added to entities that are offscreen
- Added `Entity.componentAdded$` and `Entity.componentRemoved$` for observing component changes on an entity.
- For child/parent entities:
  - Added `Entity.addChild(entity: Entity)`, `Entity.removeChild(entity: Entity)`, `Entity.removeAllChildren()` for managing child entities

  - Added `Entity.parent` readonly accessor to the parent (if exists), and `Entity.unparent()` to unparent an entity.
  - Added `Entity.getAncestors()` is a sorted list of parents starting with the topmost parent.
  - Added `Entity.children` readonly accessor to the list of children.
- Add the ability to press enter to start the game after loaded
- Add Excalibur Feature Flag implementation for releasing experimental or preview features ([#1673](https://github.com/excaliburjs/Excalibur/issues/1673))
- Color now can parse RGB/A string using Color.fromRGBString('rgb(255, 255, 255)') or Color.fromRGBString('rgb(255, 255, 255, 1)')
- `DisplayMode.FitScreen` will now scale the game to fit the available space, preserving the `aspectRatio`. ([#1733](https://github.com/excaliburjs/Excalibur/issues/1733))
- `SpriteSheet.spacing` now accepts a structure `{ top: number, left: number, margin: number }` for custom spacing dimensions ([#1788](https://github.com/excaliburjs/Excalibur/issues/1778))
- `SpriteSheet.ctor` now has an overload that accepts `spacing` for consistency although the object constructor is recommended ([#1788](https://github.com/excaliburjs/Excalibur/issues/1778))
- Add `SpriteSheet.getSpacingDimensions()` method to retrieve calculated spacing dimensions ([#1788](https://github.com/excaliburjs/Excalibur/issues/1778))
- Add `KeyEvent.value?: string` which is the key value (or "typed" value) that the browser detected. For example, holding Shift and pressing 9 will have a value of `(` which is the typed character.
- Add `KeyEvent.originalEvent?: KeyboardEvent` which exposes the raw keyboard event handled from the browser.

- Changed `moveBy`, `rotateBy`, and `scaleBy` to operate relative to the current actor position at a speed, instead of moving to an absolute by a certain time.
- Changed event handlers in excalibur to expect non-null event objects, before `hander: (event?: GameEvent) => void` implied that event could be null. This change addresses ([#1147](https://github.com/excaliburjs/Excalibur/issues/1147)) making strict null/function checks compatible with new TypeScript.
- Changed collision system to remove actor coupling, in addition `ex.Collider` is a new type that encapsulates all collision behavior. Use `ex.Actor.body.collider` to interact with collisions in Excalibur ([#1119](https://github.com/excaliburjs/Excalibur/issues/1119))
